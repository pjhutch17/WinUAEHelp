<h2><u>Speed</u></h2>
<br>
On a sufficiently powerful PC, UAE will give you quite an authentic flashback into the past.
Thanks to DirectX, the raw drawing throughput of this version will be among the highest of all 
Intel ports. 800x600 is only about 20% slower than 320x200 on a Pentium 100, although it requires 
more than seven times as many bytes per second to be pumped across the PCI bus. UAE's native 
display depth is 16 bpp. This table shows how the net drawing speed is affected by your display 
type:
<br><br>
16 bpp full screen - 100%<br>
16 bpp desktop - 98% <br>
24 bpp desktop - 72%<br>
32 bpp desktop - 60%<br>
<br><br>
Unfortunately, windowed mode clipping causes system services such as mouse/keyboard input and the 
file system to slow down (there is no way of avoiding this at the moment). This does not affect SMP 
machines.
Sound is a luxury. Because sound output is strictly synchronized with video DMA, you won't get clean 
sound unless your machine is capable of running at 50 fps at least internally.
<br><br>
<u>Rule of thumb:</u> Get a  Pentium III or Athlon if you want full graphics and full sound at the 
same time.
