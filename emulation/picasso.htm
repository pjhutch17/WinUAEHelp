<h2><u>Picasso96 Emulation</u></h2>
<br><br>
To use this feature, you must select 68020 emulation with a 32 bit address space 
in the <a href="../gui/cpu.htm">CPU</a> tab. You also need a Kickstart 3.x ROM. 
<br>
<br>
To specify how much graphics memory you want to emulate, you must adjust the RTG 
in the <a href="../gui/ram.htm">RAM</a> tab. <br>
<br>
Then, you need the Picasso 96 software which is not distributed with UAE. You 
may download the latest version from <a href="../links.htm">here</a>. Version 
1.31 or higher is recommended. Install the Picasso96 software. After that is complete, 
reboot, and you should be able to select the new modes from the ScreenModes program 
inside the Amiga. <br>
