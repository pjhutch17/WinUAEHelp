<p class="text">Emulating the OCS, ECS or AGA chipset is slow, instead, you can
  use the PC's graphics card instead to output graphics and use 256 or more colors.</p>
<p class="headline2">Set Up</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">To use this feature, you must select 68020 emulation with
    a 32 bit address space in the <a href="../gui/cpu.htm">CPU</a> tab. You also
    need a Kickstart 3.x ROM.</li>
  <li class="text">To specify how much graphics memory you want to emulate, you
    must adjust the RTG in the <a href="../gui/ram.htm">RAM</a> tab.</li>
  <li class="text"> Make sure Full Screen RTG is enabled on the <a href="../gui/display.htm">Display</a> tab. </li>
</ul>
<p class="text">Then, you need the <a href="../links.htm">Picasso 96 software</a> which
  is not distributed with WinUAE. Version 1.31 or higher is recommended. After
  you installed the Picasso96 software, reboot the emulated Amiga. Now, you should
  be able to select the new modes - which are identiefied as <em>uaegfx</em> -
  from the ScreenModes program on the Amiga.</p>

<p class="headline2">Maximize Stability and Performance </p>
<p class="text">Make sure you utilize the latest rtg.library which is located
  in the <a href="../tips/amigaprogs.htm">Amiga Programs</a> folder of your WinUAE
  installation. You have to copy that file into the following directory on your
  Workbench drive: <em>libs:picasso96</em>.</p>
<p class="text"> Start the program p96_uae_tweak from the Amiga Programs folder
  if you notice large slowdown when 16bit AHI is activated.</p>

<ul>
  <li> Currently only Permedia 2 and Voodoo cards are compatible with the Warp3D
    driver software for 3D games on the Amiga.</li>
  <li>If you get no Picasso screens larger than 1024x768 in 32bit, you have to
    copy picasso96fix from the <a href="../tips/amigaprogs.htm">Amiga Programs</a> directory
    to a drive in your emulated Amiga, and load it in the startup-sequence before
    the LoadWB command.</li>
