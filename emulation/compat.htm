<p class="headline1">Compatibility</p>
<p class="text">According to the testers and the users of WinUAE, it proved itself
  worthy. Compatibility for both UAE and it's Windows port should be really very
  close to 100%.</p>
<p class="text">If you have problems to get a certain program working, look at
  the <a href="../links.htm">Links</a>. There you will find the most comprehensive
  emulation sites on the net.</p>
<p class="text">The number of programs that don't run has been reported to be
  close to zero. If you find a piece of software to require special treatment,
  please let the developers (Bernd Schmidt for UAE, the current WinUAE maintainer
  is Toni Wilen - see <a href="../credits/about.htm">Contacts</a>) know.</p>
