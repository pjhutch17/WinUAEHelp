<h2><u>Compatibility</u></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the testers and the users of WinUAE, it proved itself worthy. 
  Compatibility for both UAE and it's Windows port should be really very close 
  to 100%.<p>If you have problems to get a certain program working, look at the <a href="../links.htm">Links</a>. 
  There you will find the most comprehensive emulation sites on the net.
  </p>
  The number of programs that don't run has been reported to be close to zero. 
If you find a piece of software to require special treatment, please let the developers 
(Bernd Schmidt for UAE, the current WinUAE maintainer is Toni Wilen - see <a href="../credits/about.htm">Contacts</a>) 
know.
