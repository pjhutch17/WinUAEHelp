<h2><u>ADF Transfer</u></h2>
<p>It is possible to transfer an ADF disk image back to an original Amiga disk. 
  Copy the ADF to an original Amiga and insert a disk into df0. Then, you will 
  also need transdisk in order to transfer the data to the disk. Do the following:</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; transdisk -w name.adf</em></p>
<p>You will have to replace name.adf with the desired name of the file. That will 
  write back to a disk in df0.</p>
<p>If you do not have an Amiga to write to Amiga disks, then I suggest getting 
  hold of the PCI Catweasel device which will allow you to write ADF files to 
  Amiga formatted disks on your PC. See <a href="http://www.jschoenfeld.com/indexe.html">Individual 
  Computers</a> for more information.</p>
<p>You can also get direct access to an Amiga's floppy drive if you have your 
  PC and Amiga networked and using the <a href="http://www.amigaforever.com/">Amiga 
  Explore</a>r supplied with Cloanto's Amiga Forever software.</p>
