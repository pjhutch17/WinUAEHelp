<p class="headline1">Winuae for First Time Users</p>
<p class="text">Hello and welcome to the Umbiquious Amiga Emulator for Windows (WinUAE). The 
  Amiga computer was a popular home computer from 1984-1994 by Commodore Business 
  Machines (CBM), which competed directly with the Atari ST, Archimedes, IBM PC 
  compatibles and other computers at the time. The Amiga was based on the Motorola 
  680x0 series of processors, had its own custom chipset for graphics and sound 
  (since there weren't that many good graphics chips around then) and ran its 
  own operating system: AmigaOS with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) called Workbench.</p>
<p class="text">There is no one model of Amiga but several, hence the complexity of Winuae, 
  it can emulate everthing from the first A1000 right up to the A4000 with the 
  popular A500 and A1200 in between. So you need a little about how to configure 
  Winuae to emulate an Amiga model with their small variations in specification 
  such as memory, cpus, custom chipsets and so on.</p>
<p class="text">1. Double click Winuae to run it.</p>
<p class="text">2. The first screen is the <a href="file:///D|/My%20Documents/HTML_Pages/CHM%20Files/1.9.1/gui/configurations.htm">Configuration</a> 
  section, there will probably no configurations set up, so you need to create 
  one. To help you, I have a table of popular Amiga models you can emulate on 
  the <a href="examples.htm">Examples</a> page. You will need to set up Chipset, 
  CPU and RAM and ROM pages in particular to match the Amiga to emulate.</p>
<p class="text">3. Programs and games are usually distributed on 880K floppy disks in an incompatible 
  format called OFS (Original Filing System) or FFS (Fast Filing System), which 
  PC's cannot read directly. So, these disks are copied into a file called an 
  ADF (Amiga Disk Format), on some emulators these are called 'ROMs'. To load 
  an ADF disk, click on the <a href="file:///d|/My%20Documents/HTML_Pages/CHM%20Files/1.9.1/gui/floppies.htm">Disk 
  Drives </a> tab. Then click on the elipses ( ... ) opposite DF0 and select an 
  ADF file from either your hard disk or other location. </p>
<p class="text">4. If a game, came on multiple disks, you can insert them into further floppy 
  drives, named DF1, DF2 and DF3. Note that a few games assume there is only one 
  floppy drive (DF0) and will only look there. So watch out. If while playing 
  a game and you need to change disks, press <strong>F12</strong> to load the Winuae GUI 
  and click on Floppies, select <strong>Eject</strong> next to floppy drive and load the 
  next disk. Alternatively, press END and F1, F2, F3 or F4 to change a disk in 
  DF0-DF3.</p>
<p class="text">5. Amigas can also use <a href="file:///d|/My%20Documents/HTML_Pages/CHM%20Files/1.9.1/gui/hard-drives.htm">Hard 
  Drives</a> like the PC, you can either use a normal directory on a PC hard disk 
  to store Amiga files or you can use a HardFile, which is one big file that stores 
  all the Amiga files together. You can also use real Amiga formatted disks as 
  well. To access data on PC volumes, tick <strong>Add PC Drives at Startup.</strong><br>
  <br>
  a) To set up a Directory, click Hard Drives, click Add Directory, then give 
  the disk a device name e.g. DH0, a volume name e.g. System and the location 
  of the directory e.g. c:\AmigaForever\System for example.</p>
<p class="text">b) To set up a Hard File, click Hard Drives, click Add Hardfile, under <strong>New 
  Hard File, </strong>enter the size of the Hard file in Megabytes, anything from 10MB 
  to 2GB is possible, click on <strong>Create, </strong>select the location and name of 
  the hard file and click <strong>Save</strong>. You can load an existing hard file via 
  the <strong>Path</strong> ... button.</p>
<p class="text">c) If you have a real Amiga Hard Disk, and it is connected directly to your 
  PC, you can select it from a list via the <strong>Add Harddrive</strong> button.</p>
<p class="text">6. To set up a CDROM drive for access via Winuae, click on the <a href="file:///d|/My%20Documents/HTML_Pages/CHM%20Files/1.9.1/gui/misc.htm">Misc</a> 
  tab and enable the <strong>UAEscsi.device</strong>, when you load up Workbench, you need 
  to install an Amiga compatible CDROM filesystem such as CacheCDFS, AmiCDFS, 
  IDEFix and so on. The device name for the <strong>CD0</strong> DosDriver should be UAEscsi.device 
  and the unit number is usually 0 or 1 (if unsure, <strong>enable logging</strong> on the 
  Misc page and start Winuae to create a log file and it will tell you what your 
  CDROM unit numbers are), see the Icon Information and change the tooltypes to 
  change these values.</p>
<p class="text">7. When your configuration is complete, click the <strong>OK</strong> button to start 
  the emulation. If no hard disk or bootable floppy is found, you may see the 
  Insert Disk screen, press F12 and click on Floppies to change the disk and click 
  OK to restart. If the emulation crashes or fails to boot, press F12, goto Misc 
  screen and click <strong>Reset Amiga</strong> and then OK. </p>
<p class="text">8. When finished with the emulation you can press <strong>Ctrl+F11, </strong>close the 
  Window, or press F12 and click Quit on the Misc tab.</p>
