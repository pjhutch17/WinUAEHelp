<p class="headline1">Data Transfer Amiga &lt;-&gt; PC</p>
<p class="text">In the process of preparing for emulation, you will need to transfer
  the files between your PC where you run UAE on and your Amiga. There are several
  ways how to do this:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">If you are using a null modem cable, you will need a terminal
    program on your Windows machine and your Amiga. 68000 equipped Amigas are
    only able to reach approximately 3000cps through the null modem cable. This
    speed is achieved with the standard serial.device or the new baudbandit.device
    There are some tools available which can speed up the connection speed up
    to 5500cps. For more help on how to set up a serial transfer see <a href="http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/homepage/c725/c72578/amiga/ADFsenderterminal/methods.html">ADF
    Sender Terminal FAQ</a> and <a href="http://amiga.nvg.org/warlock/wartrans/">WarTrans</a>.
    The <a href="../links.htm">Aminet</a> is a great source for such tools such
    as TwinExpress and AmiTrans.<br>
  </li>
  <li class="text">If you have an Amiga with OS 2.0 or later, you may use <strong>CrossDOS</strong>.
    It is a part of the AmigaOS and enables you to read and write DOS formatted
    floppies on your Amiga. <strong>MessyDOS</strong> or <strong>MSH</strong> is
    a freeware program with the same functionality. It can be found on Aminet.
    If you do not have a high density floppy drive in your Amiga, you will have
    to use 720kB formatted disks. Compress the disk image with - for example
    - LHA and copy the compressed file on the floppy. Copy the file to your Windows
    machine and decompress it.<br>
  </li>
  <li class="text">If you have a PC with 2 floppy disks then you can use the <a href="http://www.oldskool.org/disk2fdi">Disk2FDI</a> which
    will allow you to read an Amiga disk in A: and read and transfer the contents
    to the second B: drive. The FDI files can then be directly read with WinUAE.<br>
  </li>
  <li class="text">If you have Cloanto's <a href="http://www.amigaforever.com/">Amiga
      Explorer</a> program then you can set up a PC to Amiga link and use a friendly
      front end program to transfer programs to and from your PC and your Amiga.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">In either case, you ought to read the documentation for the programs
  that you use for the transfer.</p>
