<p class="headline1">Data Transfer Amiga &lt;-&gt; PC</p>
<p class="text">In the process of preparing for emulation, you will need to transfer
  the files between your PC where you run UAE on and your Amiga. There are several
  ways how to do this:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">If you are using a null modem cable, you will need a terminal
    program on your Windows machine and your Amiga. 68000 equipped Amigas are
    only able to reach approximately 3000cps through the null modem cable. This
    speed is achieved with the standard serial.device or the new baudbandit.device
    There are some tools available which can speed up the connection speed up
    to 5500cps. For more help on how to set up a serial transfer see <a href="../links.htm">ADF
    Sender Terminal FAQ</a> and <a href="../links.htm#tools">WarTrans</a>. The <a href="../links.htm#original">Aminet</a> is
    a great source for such tools such as TwinExpress and AmiTrans.<br>
  </li>
  <li class="text">If you have an Amiga with OS 2.0 or later, you may use <strong>CrossDOS</strong>.
    It is a part of the AmigaOS and enables you to read and write DOS formatted
    floppies on your Amiga. <strong>MessyDOS</strong> or <strong>MSH</strong> is
    a freeware program with the same functionality. It can be found on Aminet.
    If you do not have a high density floppy drive in your Amiga, you will have
    to use 720kB formatted disks. Compress the disk image with - for example
    - LHA and copy the compressed file on the floppy. Copy the file to your Windows
    machine and decompress it.<br>
  </li>
  <li class="text">If you have a PC with 2 floppy disks then you can use the <a href="../links.htm#tools">Disk2FDI</a> which
    will allow you to read an Amiga disk in A: and read and transfer the contents
    to the second B: drive. The FDI files can then be directly read with WinUAE.<br>
  </li>
  <li class="text">If you have <a href="../links.htm#allinone">Cloanto's</a> Amiga
    Explorer program then you can set up a PC to Amiga link and use a friendly
    front end program to transfer programs to and from your PC and your Amiga.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">In either case, you ought to read the documentation for the programs
  that you use for the transfer.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Serial Transfer</p>
<p class="text">If you do not have Crossdos or MSH installed on your Amiga, a
  serial network is needed to transfer files between them instead of via floppy.
  All you need is the following items:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Terminal software for Amiga and PC, preferably ones than can
    do Binary Transfers using common protocols such as Kermit and X/Y/ZModem.
    Amiga term programs include NComm, JRComm, and Term. PC term programs include
    Terminal and Terminus.</li>
  <li class="text">A commonly used program called Twin Express can be used instead
    or <em>PC2Ami</em> or <a href="../links.htm#tools">AmigaTrans</a> or Amiga
    Explorer from <a href="../links.htm#allinone">Cloanto</a>.</li>
  <li class="text">A serial cable with 9pin end for PC and 25 pin end for Amiga.
    It has to be a null-modem cable which means that lines 2 and 3 have to cross
    over to receive/transmit between peers and line 7 for control signals. See <a href="../links.htm#help">RS232
    cable information</a> for a null modem cable specification.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">Then, do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"> Connect the computers with serial lead and load up the software
    on each end.</li>
  <li class="text"> Start binary receive on one end using one of the protocols
    common to both programs.</li>
  <li class="text"> Start binary transmit on the other and load the file to be
    transmitted, it should then transfer to the other end in seconds/minutes
    depending on size.</li>
  <li class="text">Further details of networking can be found at <a href="../links.htm#help">Amiga
      Emulation FAQ</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Network Transfer</p>
<p class="text">You can try <a href="../links.htm#allinone">Cloanto</a>'s Amiga
  Explorer which does not require a program on Amiga side to start off with!<br>
  You can also use AmigaToPC, which is a professional network software setup,
  and can be found at our links page in the <a href="../links.htm#tools">tools
  section</a>.</p>
