<p class="text">If you are using Windows 95 and don't have DirectX installed
  yet, you need to grab and install a copy first. UAE works with DirectX 8 or
  later. Select Start, Run and enter DXDIAG to see what version you have installed.
  WinUAE no longer supports Windows NT 4.0, please use Windows 9x/ME/2000 or
  XP. WinUAE 0.8.8 still supports Windows NT 4.0 (see <strong>WinUAE-compat.exe</strong>).
  If short on memory or CPU, please use the <strong>WinUAE-mini.exe </strong>(0.8.22r8).</p>
<p class="text">WinUAE requires some Amiga software in order to work properly:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">The Kickstart, a ROM chip which contains essential parts of
    the Operating System and an Amiga can not boot without it.<br>
    A copy of your Kickstart ROM (sometimes referred as a ROM-image, ROM-file,
    KickFile, or KickROM) into a file called kick.ROM. If you own an Amiga, you
    can extract a ROM-image using the included <a href="transrom.htm">transrom</a> utility,
    which must be run on your Amiga.<br>
    If you no longer own an Amiga, you can obtain a legal copy of a Kickstart
    ROM from Cloanto's <a href="../credits/about.htm">Amiga Forever</a> software
    package. Kickstarts are supplied on the <strong>Amiga Forever</strong> CD
    in <em>\Emulation\shared\</em>ROM. If you have the <strong>Amiga Classix
    CD</strong>, you can find a Kickstart 1.3 ROM file on it.<br>
  </li>
  <li class="text">The Workbench, which is the Amiga's User Interface to manage
    files and start applications, in other terms AmigaOS. <br>
    If you own an Amiga, you can transfer your Workbench disks to the .adf file-format
    used by UAE by running the included <a href="transdisk.htm"> Transdisk</a> utility.
    Again, this must be run on your Amiga. If you no longer own an Amiga, you
    can obtain a legal copy of various Amiga OS releases from Cloanto's Amiga
    Forever software package.<br>
    A larger set of Workbench disks (up to 3.1) can be found on the <strong>Amiga
    Forever</strong> CD in <em>\Emulation\shared\ADF</em> and a full Workbench
    directory hard disk set up in <em>\Emulation\shared\dir</em>.<br>
    Workbench or <strong>AmigaOS 3.5</strong> or <strong>3.9</strong> CD can
    be purchased from any good <a href="../links.htm#shops">Amiga dealer</a> and
    can be read directly on a PC as a Read Only Directory based Hard Disk on
    WinUAE.<br>
    If you have WB 2.0 or better, try ADF Blitzer, which has a nice Workbench
    frontend!</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">If you are done with creating the necessary files on your Amiga,
  have a look at the <a href="pcamitrans.htm">Data Transfer Amiga &lt;-&gt; PC</a> page.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text">WinUAE
    is a fairly hungry application and requires alot of computing power to accurately
    emulate the Amiga. The following system is recommended before running WinUAE:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Pentium III 1GHz (or higher)</li>
  <li class="text">128MB of RAM</li>
  <li class="text">PCI sound-card</li>
  <li class="text">PCI or AGP graphics-card</li>
  <li class="text">Windows 9x/Me/2000/XP with DirectX 8.0 (or higher)</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">If you have everything you need, continue with the <a href="../gui/main.htm">GUI</a> to
  configure WinUAE properly. If the setup of the program is complete and the
  emulation is working, please refer to <a href="../emulation/main.htm">The Emulation</a> for
  information if you have problems with certain Amiga - programs, and also for
  information on how to get out the most of WinUAE.</p>
