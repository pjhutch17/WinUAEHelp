<p class="headline1">Requirements</p>
<p class="text">If you are using Windows 95 and don't have DirectX installed yet, you need to 
grab and install a copy first. UAE works with DirectX 8 or later. Select Start, 
Run and enter DXDIAG to see what version you have installed.</p>
<p class="text">WinUAE no longer supports Windows NT 4.0, please use Windows 9x/ME/2000 or XP. 
Winuae 0.8.8 still supports Windows NT 4.0 (see <strong>Winuae-compat.exe</strong>). If 
short on memory or CPU, please use the <strong>Winuae-mini.exe </strong>(0.8.22r8).</p>
<p class="text">WinUAE requires some Amiga software in order to work properly:</p>
<ul>
<li class="text">A copy of your Kickstart ROM (sometimes referred as a ROM-image, ROM-file, 
  KickFile, or KickROM) into a file called kick.rom. If you own an Amiga, you 
  can extract a ROM-image using the included <a href="transrom.htm">Transrom</a> 
  utility, which must be run on your Amiga. If you no longer own an Amiga, you 
  can obtain a legal copy of a Kickstart ROM from Cloanto's <a href="../credits/about.htm">Amiga 
  Forever</a> software package.<br>
</li>
<li class="text">A copy of your Amiga OS disks (sometimes referrred to as Workbench).If you own an Amiga, you can transfer 
your Workbench diskettes to the .ADF file-format used by UAE by running the included <a href="transdisk.htm">
Transdisk</a> utility. 
Again, this must be run on your Amiga. If you no longer own an Amiga, you can obtain a legal copy of 
various Amiga OS releases from Cloanto's Amiga Forever software package.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="text"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Amiga Forever includes an utility called Amiga Explorer, which allows you to connect a real 
Amiga and your Windows PC together, for easy transfer of files from your Amiga to your PC.</p>
<p class="text"><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Amiga software (ROMs and Workbench) is copyright material, and is not free. No one of the WinUAE 
team will provide Kickstart ROM-images, or Amiga OS (Workbench) disks.</p>
<p class="text">On the Windows side, WinUAE is a fairly hungry application and requires alot of 
compute-power to accurately emulate the Amiga. The following System is recommended 
before running WinUAE:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Pentium 233MMX or higher processor </li>
  <li class="text">64-Megs of RAM </li>
  <li class="text">PCI sound-card</li>
  <li class="text">PCI or AGP graphics-card </li>
  <li class="text">Windows 9x/Me/2000/XP with DirectX 8.0 (or higher)</li>
  <li class="text">Joystick</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">If you have everything you need, continue with the <a href="../gui/main.htm">GUI</a> 
to configure WinUAE properly. If the setup of the program is complete and the 
emulation is working, please refer to <a href="main-emul.htm"> The Emulation</a> 
for information if you have problems with certain Amiga - programs, and also for 
information on how to get out the most of WinUAE.</p>
