<p class="text">To actually run anything in UAE, you will need to install a Amiga
  Kickstart ROM image from an Amiga. You can't run UAE if you don't have this
  image.</p>
<p class="text">Kickstart ROMs and Workbench disks are COPYRIGHTED by Amiga,
  Inc. and it is ILLEGAL to distribute them or download them from unauthorised
  sites.</p>
<p class="text"> These files are not included in WinUAE because of this. If you
  own a real Amiga, you can create everything you need yourself. This can be
  done with <a href="transrom.htm">transrom</a>. Alternatively, emulation packages
  can be bought from <a href="../links.htm#allinone">Cloanto</a> directly or
  at <a href="../links.htm#shops">one of the listed shops</a>.</p>
<p class="text">If you transfer commercial software, you must not distribute
  the resulting image files without permission of the copyright owner. The Kickstart
  ROM has to be considered commercial software. You may not distribute Kickstart
  ROM files. Please read the license that came with your software for details.</p>
<p class="text">Neither WinUAE nor this helpfile will point you at illegal download
  sites, nor will you be provided with copyrighted material by any of the involved
  people.</p>
