<p>Since the PC floppy controller can't read Amiga disks, floppy access has to 
  be emulated differently: Floppies are emulated by means of disk files that contain 
  a raw image of the floppy disk you want to emulate. They can be created with 
  <a href="transdisk.htm">transdisk</a>.</p>
<p>To actually run anything in UAE, you will need to install a Amiga Kickstart 
  ROM image from an Amiga. You can't run UAE if you don't have this image. It 
  is not included because it is copyrighted software. It has to be created with 
  <a href="transrom.htm">transrom</a>.</p>

<p><br>
  In the &quot;Amiga Programs&quot; subdirectory you will find the two small Amiga 
  programs that will help you generate the necessary image files. After you copied 
  the tools to your Amiga, open the CLI. Refer to the transrom &amp; transdisk 
  pages for further information. <b>NEVER</b> run either of these programs from 
  the Workbench! Always open a Shell or CLI window to do this.
<p>UAE needs a Kickstart ROM file and a bootable disk image in order to boot the 
  emulated Amiga. Disks can be inserted using the <a
href="../gui/floppies.htm">Floppies</a> tab in the <a href="../gui/main.htm">GUI</a>. 
  UAE has to be configured to use a &quot;Kickstart ROM&quot; in the <a
href="../gui/rom.htm">ROM</a> tab.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you transfer commercial software, you must not distribute the
resulting image files, since that would be a violation of copyright law. The Kickstart ROM
has to be considered commercial software. You may only use the Kickstart from your own
Amiga, and you may not distribute Kickstart ROM files. Please read the license that came
with your software for details.</p>
