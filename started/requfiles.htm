<p class="text">Since the PC floppy controller can't read Amiga disks, floppy
  access has to be emulated differently: Floppies are emulated by means of disk
  files that contain a raw image of the floppy disk you want to emulate. They
  can be created with <a href="transdisk.htm">transdisk</a>.</p>
<p class="text">As mentioned in the <a href="legal.htm">Legal Notes</a>, you
  can not use WinUAE without an Amiga Kickstart ROM image. However, you can create
  on from your real Amiga using <a href="transrom.htm">transrom</a>.</p>
<p class="text">In the &quot;Amiga Programs&quot; subdirectory you will find
  the two small Amiga programs that will help you generate the necessary image
  files. After you copied the tools to your Amiga, open the CLI. Refer to the
  transrom &amp; transdisk pages for further information. <strong>NEVER</strong> run
  either of these programs from the Workbench! Always open a Shell or CLI window
  to do this.</p>
<p class="text">UAE needs a Kickstart ROM file and a bootable disk image in order
  to boot the emulated Amiga. Disks can be inserted using the <a href="../gui/floppies.htm">Floppies</a> tab
  in the <a href="../gui/main.htm">GUI</a>. UAE has to be configured to use a &quot;Kickstart
  ROM&quot; in the <a href="../gui/rom.htm">ROM</a> tab.</p>
