  <br>
  With the ... buttons you can select .adf - files, which will then be available 
  within the "Amiga" as disks. <b>Eject</b> removes the disk from the drive. <b>Disable</b> 
  will disable the drive and free up some memory (vital for old games). Note that 
  <b>DF0</b> is the default drive to boot off, so please use this before other 
  drives.<br>
  <br>
  With <b>Create Standard "Floppy"</b> you can create a blank .adf - file. You 
  can use these files as empty floppies. <br>
  <br>
  With <b>Create Custom "Floppy"</b> you can create a special .adf file for saving 
  games onto if the Standard floppy does not work. </p>
<p>For each drive, you can specify the drive type: 3.5&quot; DD (880K), 3.5&quot; 
  HD (1.76Mb) and the old 5.25&quot; SD (440K).</p>
<p>Click the '...' button to select your ADF, FDI, DMS, ADZ etc floppy image from 
  the hard disk. You can also select a disk image from the <b>pull down menus</b> 
  from previous selections.</p>
<p>Click the <b>Eject </b>button to remove a disk image from a disk drive.</p>
<p>Enable the <b>Write Protected</b> option to emulate the write protect tab on 
  your disk images.<br>
  <br>
  To get information about adf files and how to obtain them, view the <a href="../started/require.htm">Requirements</a> 
  and <a href="../started/transdisk.htm">Transdisk</a>. <br>
  <br>
  WinUAE has a built in support for zip and gzip compressed disk images and ROMs. 
  This support is provided by the well known zlib library. Compressed disks will 
  be write protected. <br>
  <br>
  You can also use DMS compressed files with WinUAE. You only have to copy the 
  xDMS - executable to a system directory (z.B. c:\windows\command). The PATH 
  variable must point to that directory. <br>
  <br>
  Inserting a Zip file with multiple images will allow WinUAE to automatically 
  select the first ADF file it finds.</p>
<p>Executable files inserted into a floppy drive will be converted to ADF format 
  and saved to a new floppy disk ADF file.</p>
<p>The <b>Floppy Speed</b> slider will allow to adjust floppy access speed from 
  <b>Turbo, 100, 200, 400 or 800%</b> of speed.</p>
