<p class="headline1">Disk Drives</p>
<p class="text">Using this tab, you can &quot;insert&quot; disks into your virtual
  Amiga. Press F12 and get this screen or for each drive,or press <strong>END</strong> and
  F1, F2, F3 or F4 to insert a disk into one drive. Use <strong>SHIFT+END</strong> and
  function key to Eject a disk.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="floppy.gif" alt="WinUAE - Floppies"></p>
<p class="text">With the ... buttons you can select .adf - files, which will
  then be available within the &quot;Amiga&quot; as disks. <strong>Eject</strong> removes
  the disk from the drive. <strong>Disable</strong> will disable the drive and
  free up some memory (vital for old games). Note that <strong>DF0</strong> is
  the default drive to boot off, so please use this before other drives.</p>
<p class="text">With <strong>Create Standard &quot;Floppy&quot;</strong> you
  can create a blank .adf - file. You can use these files as empty floppies.</p>
<p class="text">With <strong>Create Custom &quot;Floppy&quot;</strong> you can
  create a special .adf file for saving games onto if the Standard floppy does
  not work. </p>
<p class="text">For each drive, you can specify the drive type: 3.5&quot; DD
  (880K), 3.5&quot; HD (1.76Mb) and the old 5.25&quot; SD (440K).</p>
<p class="text">Click the '...' button to select your ADF, FDI, DMS, ADZ etc
  floppy image from the hard disk. You can also select a disk image from the <strong>pull
  down menus</strong> from previous selections.</p>
<p class="text">Click the <strong>Eject</strong> button to remove a disk image
  from a disk drive.</p>
<p class="text">Enable the <strong>Write Protected</strong> option to emulate
  the write protect tab on your disk images.</p>
<p class="text">To get information about ADF-files and how to obtain them, view
  the <a href="../started/require.htm">Requirements</a> and <a href="../started/transdisk.htm">Transdisk</a>.</p>
<p class="text">WinUAE has a built in support for zip and gzip compressed disk
  images and ROMs. This support is provided by the well known zlib library. Compressed
  disks will be write protected. You can also use DMS compressed files with WinUAE.
  You only have to copy the xDMS - executable to a system directory (z.B. c:\windows\command).
  The PATH variable must point to that directory.<br>
  Inserting a Zip file with multiple images will allow WinUAE to automatically
  select the first ADF file it finds.<br>
  Executable files inserted into a floppy drive will be converted to ADF format
  and saved to a new floppy disk ADF file.</p>
<p class="text">The <strong>Floppy Speed</strong> slider will allow to adjust
  floppy access speed from <strong>Turbo, 100, 200, 400 or 800%</strong> of speed.</p>
