<p class="headline1">RAM</p>
<p class="text">These settings let you set up how much memory you will allocate
  (steal) from Windows.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ram.gif" alt="WinUAE - RAM"></p>
<p class="text">With these 5 trackbars you are able to control the settings for
  the RAM for your emulated Amiga, and what types of memory to emulate. If you
  select more RAM than your Computer has, Windows will swap the content of the &quot;memory&quot; to
  the harddisk which is very slow.</p>
<p class="headline2">Available RAM Settings</p>
<ul>
<li class="text"><strong>Chip RAM</strong> is for the Amiga's custom chip especially
  used by graphics and sound to store images and sound information when using
  OCS, ECS or AGA modes.On a real Amiga, 2MB is the maximum but you can have
  upto 8MB with WinUAE!</li>
<li class="text"><strong>Fast RAM</strong> is used by the Amiga's Processor. Its
  called Fast RAM for two reasons, one is that the processor does not have to
  share this ram with the custom chip set and the memory chips tend to be faster
  as well. You can specify upto 8MB of Fast RAM.</li>
<li class="text"><strong>Slow RAM</strong> is similar to Fast RAM, but due to
  its connection via the Trapdoor of an A500 or via PCMCIA cards, it was slower
  than using Fast RAM. Only use this if certain games accepted this than Fast
  RAM.</li>
<li class="text"><strong>Z3-Fast</strong> is similar to Fast RAM but supplied
  via the Zorro 3 slots on big box Amigas. You can have upto 256MB of this RAM!</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>RTG </strong> is for graphics card use such as the Picasso96 
    Retargetable Graphics system so that you can use your PC's graphics card rather 
    than the custom chips for extra speed.</li>
</ul>
