<h2><u>RAM Settings</u></h2>
<br>
These settings let you set up how much memory you will allocate (steal) from Windows.

  With these 5 trackbars you are able to control the settings for the RAM for 
  your emulated Amiga, and what types of memory to emulate. If you select more 
  RAM than your Computer has, Windows will swap the content of the "memory" to 
  the harddisk which is very slow. </p>
<p><b>Chip RAM</b> is for the Amiga's custom chip especially used by graphics 
  and sound to store images and sound information when using OCS, ECS or AGA modes.On 
  a real Amiga, 2Mb is the maximum but you can have upto 8Mb with Winuae!</p>
<p><b>Fast RAM</b> is used by the Amiga's Processor. Its called Fast RAM for two 
  reasons, one is that the processor does not have to share this ram with the 
  custom chip set and the memory chips tend to be faster as well. You can specify 
  upto 8Mb of Fast RAM.</p>
<p><b>Slow RAM</b> is similar to Fast RAM, but due to its location via the Trapdoor 
  of an A500 or via PCMCIA cards, it was slower than using Fast RAM. Only use 
  this if certain games accepted this than Fast RAM.</p>
<p><b>Z3-Fast</b> is similar to Fast RAM but supplied via the Zorro 3 slots on 
  big box Amigas. You can have upto 256Mb of this RAM!</p>
<p><b>RTG (graphics card)</b> is for graphics card use such as the Picasso96 Retargetable 
  Graphics system so that you can use your PC's graphics card rather than the 
  custom chips for extra speed.</p>
