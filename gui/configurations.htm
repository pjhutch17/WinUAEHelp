<h2><u>Configurations</u></h2>
<br><Br>
These settings allow you to manage config-files (which have the extension .uae).  These config-files 
have both a name and description, and control the behaviour of WinUAE. Basically, a config-file is an 
encapsulation of the settings found on all the other pages in the GUI.

  <u>Loading a Configuration:</u> <Br>
  <Br>
  You can load a configuration by selecting it from the list and then clicking 
  the Load button, or by double-clicking a configuration in the list. You can 
  use the Load From button to load a configuration from a different location on 
  the hard disk.<Br>
  <Br>
  Additionally, you can double-click any .uae config-file from the Windows Explorer, 
  or from a Desktop Shortcut. The configuration will load, and if the <a href="misc.htm">Show 
  GUI on Startup</a> setting is disabled, WinUAE will immediately launch into 
  emulation-mode, bypassing the GUI completely. <Br>
  <Br>
  <u>Saving a Configuration:</u> <Br>
  <Br>
  To save your changes for a configuration which you've loaded, simply press the 
  Save button. If you've made changes to a configuration and want to save it under 
  a different name, simply change the Name field on this page of the GUI or select 
  Save As. You can also adjust the Description field. </p>
<p>If you upgrade your version of Winuae, it is best to delete or update your 
  current configuration for the new version of Winuae to use the new features!<Br>
  <Br>
  <u>Deleting a Configuration:</u> <Br>
  <Br>
  Select a configuration from the list, and click the Delete button. <Br>
</p>
<p><u>Exiting Winuae Program</u></p>
<p>Select <b>Quit </b>or click on the X in the Window.<br>
</p>
<p><u>Resetting Amiga</u> </p>
<p>Select <b>Reset</b> to restart the Amiga (equivalent to Ctrl+Amiga+Amiga keys)</p>
