<h2><u><b>Display Settings</b></u></h2>
<br>
These settings allow you to choose how WinUAE will display your Amiga-generated graphics.  In a 
window, in a full-screen display, what resolution,  etc.

  UAE uses DirectX in order to produce the graphics-output. You will need at least 
  DirectX 8 for increased performance in Picasso96 screens. See <a href="misc.htm">Misc.</a> 
  tab. UAE's native pixel format is 16 Bit. <br>
  <br>
  View the <a href="picasso.htm">Picasso96</a> section to get more information 
  about this feature. <br>

  <u><br>
  Screen</u> <br>
</p>
<p><b>Primary Display driver. </b>Here, you can select which graphics card you 
  can display your Amiga screen on, useful if you have multiple monitors connected 
  to your system.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Resolution:</b> This sets the full screen resolution (see Settings) and 
  the Frequency (usually set to screen Default).</p>
<p><b>Vsync</b> can be used in Full Screen mode at 50/100Hz (PAL) or 60/120Hz 
  (NTSC).</p>
<p><b>Windowed. </b>This lets you change the resolution used for the Amiga displayed 
  in a Window on the PC screen.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <u>Settings</u> <br>
</p>
<p><br>
  <b>Full-Screen</b> displays the Amiga in Full-Screen. If this is disabled, WinUAE 
  will be visible as a window on your Desktop. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Full Screen RTG</b> displays the full screen displays in a Window, if it 
  is not selected. </p>
<p><b>Correct aspect</b> will omit certain lines of the display to make it fit 
  better into the screen. </p>
<p><b>Lo-Res</b> tells UAE to omit drawing every second pixel horizontally. <br>
  <br>
  <u>Line Mode</u> <br>
  <br>
  <b>Normal</b> draws every line once. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Doubled</b> draws every line twice. This allows interlace mode to be emulated 
  nicely, but of course you also need a display that is twice as high. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Scanline</b> will not draw certain lines, leaving them black. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <u>Centering</u> will center the Amiga display on the screen. This can be horizontally 
  and/or vertically. <br>
  <br>
  <u>Detect Pixel Format</u> will detect your graphics format with a resolution 
  of 640x480 at 60Hz with 16 or 32 bit color depth To do so, UAE will switch the 
  graphics mode to that format for approximately 2 seconds. You should do this 
  procedure, when UAE is installed, or you have installed a new graphics card.
