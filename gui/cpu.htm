<p class="headline1">CPU Settings</p>
<p class="text">These settings control the type of Motorola 680x0 CPU which will 
  be emulated.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="cpu.gif" alt="Winuae - CPU"></p>
<p class="headline2">CPU Type</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>68000</strong> is the basic CPU type, as found in the 
    Amiga 500, 1000, and 2000 models.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>68010</strong> is a slightly more advanced 68K member, 
    but never actually shipped in a real Amiga.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>68020</strong> is a much more advanced 68K CPU, with 
    some new instructions, and a fully 32-bit engine. Used in the A2500 for brief 
    period on the A2520 card. If 24 bit addressing is enabled, it is the same 
    as th 68EC020 chip in the A1200.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>68030</strong> This is a mid range CPU used in the 
    A3000 and low end A4000s.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>68040</strong> is the top CPU provided with the A4000 
    desktop computer</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>68060 </strong>is the top end CPU mainly provided on 
    accelerator cards and the A4000T. It requires the 68060.library installed 
    before using.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="text"><b>24 bit addressing</b> is used mainly by the <b>68EC020 </b>CPU 
  such as the A1200.</p>
<p class="text"><strong>More compatible</strong> is only available when the CPU 
  type is a <strong>68000</strong>. Some games and demos require this setting 
  for proper compatibility.</p>
<p class="text"><strong>JIT</strong> can be enabled to access the Advanced JIT 
  settings if the 68030 or better is selected (See below).</p>
<p class="headline2">FPU</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>None.</strong> No FPU is provided, this is the only 
    option for the 68000 and 68010.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>68881.</strong> Can be specified with the 68020 and 
    68030.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>68882.</strong> Can be specified with the 68020 and 
    68030.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>CPU internal.</strong> Can be specified for the 68040 
    and 68060.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text"><strong>More Compatible</strong> is available if a FPU is selected. 
  Some applications require this for proper compatibility.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">CPU Emulation Speed</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>Fastest possible</strong> lets the CPU section of
    the emulation run as many cycles as possible, while still maintaining emulation
    of the custom-chips at the appropriate rate. It is important to keep sound
    and graphics synchronized, no matter how fast the PC is.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Match A500 speed</strong> limits the CPU emulation
    to run the same number of cycles per vertical-blank as a standard A500 would.
    In other words, for every 50Hz refresh of the graphics, the same number of
    CPU instructions will be executed as on a real A500 computer.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Adjustable between CPU and chipset</strong> lets you
    tweak the balance of power between custom-chip emulation, and CPU speed.
    Some games and demos require this setting to be adjusted. This setting is
    the only CPU setting which can be changed once WinUAE is running.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text"><strong>CPU Idle </strong>You can adjust the idle status of the
  CPU with this slider. This feature can be useful on notebooks to keep the
  CPU cooler. See the <a href="../tips/generaltips.htm">Hints For Power Users</a> page. </p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">JIT Settings</p>
<p class="text">Due to the importance of the JIT engine and its complexity, it has its own <a href="../emulation/jit.htm">page</a> where
  you will find a description of its possibilities.</p>
