<h2><u>Hard Drives</u></h2>
<br><br>
This tab contains some very important options, because you can configure harddisks for your "Amiga".
<br><br>

  <br>
  Since using diskfiles is awkward, it is necessary to emulate harddisks. There 
  are two ways how you can use large amounts of data with UAE: harddisk files 
  and mounted directories. <br>
  <br>
  <u><b>Add Directory...</b></u></p>
<p align="center"> <img src="hddir.gif" width="350" height="212"></p>
<p>Adds a virtual HDD to your Amiga. You can specify a path to your desired folder 
  in Windows,a Volume name and a device name (usually DHx) which will be used 
  for the hard drive in the emulation. <br>
  <br>
  This has some major advantages: </p>
<ul>
  <li>It has no problems with Kickstart 1.3 </li>
  <li>It is more convenient. </li>
  <li>It is much faster.</li>
</ul>
You can also use native filesystems to mount Amiga CD-ROMs, and you can abuse 
the hardfile emulation to mount floppy disks.<br>
If you have AmigaOS 3.9 CD you can boot from the <b>Emergency-Boot</b> directory 
to load Workbench (to read/write to it, copy the directory to your hard disk first 
and boot from that).<br>
If you have Cloanto's Amiga Forever, you can boot from the supplied shared directory 
in <b>C:\Program Files\Cloanto\Amiga Forever\Emulation\Shared\<br>
dir\System</b> folder.<br>
<br>

<u><b>Add Hardfile...</b></u>
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="hardfile.gif" alt="Add Hardfile">
</center>
<p><br>
  <Br>
  With this dialog you can add an hardfile. If you want to use an existing file, 
  just click the ... button opposite <b>Path </b>and select the hdf file. If you 
  want to add a new file, specify the number of megabytes (MB) you want it to 
  be then click on <b>Create</b>, then in the dialog box state where on your PC 
  hard disk you want to save your file e.g. System.hdf. I suggest 50 MB or greater.<br>
  <br>
  Harddisk files are large files that contain the image of an Amiga filesystem. 
  They work much the same way as a disk file. You can simply create a large empty 
  file and tell UAE to use it as a hardfile, but you will need to format it from 
  the emulation before you can actually use it. <br>
</p>
<p>If you are want to boot a hardfile under Kickstart 1.3, you need the FastFileSystem 
  file from the L: directory to be placed in the kickstart roms-directory where 
  Winuae is installed.<br>
  <br>
  If you are using Winuae 0.8.22r1 or earlier and Kickstart 1.3 or earlier, hardfiles 
  can't currently be mounted at boot time, and therefore you can't boot from it 
  either. You will have to boot either from a <a href="floppies.htm"> Floppy Disk 
  Image</a> or from a <a href="filesys.htm">Filesystem</a>, and mount the hardfile.device 
  later. To do this, add the following to "DEVS:mountlist": <br>
  <br>
  <i>UAE0:<br>
  Device = uaehf.device<br>
  Unit = 0<br>
  Flags = 0<br>
  Surfaces = 1<br>
  BlocksPerTrack = 32<br>
  Reserved = 1<br>
  Interleave = 0<br>
  LowCyl = 0 ; HighCyl = 511<br>
  Buffers = 5<br>
  DosType = 0x444F5300<br>
  BufMemType = 1<br>
  </i> <br>
  <br>
  You may need to adjust the values if you specified a different geometry, and/or 
  your hardfile has a different size than 8MB, and/or the hardfile is not mounted 
  as DH0: because you mounted other harddisks before it. Then, type "mount DH0:" 
  (or put that command in your startup-sequence), and you should be able to access 
  it. Don't forget to format it with the AmigaOS ! </p>
<p>If using HDToolbox to manage Hard files, then you must create hardfile normally 
  or use harddisk image from your real Amiga but clear all<br>
  hardfile parameters except block size.(sectors, surfaces and reserved)</p>
<p>HDToolBox must be run with &quot;uaehf.device&quot;-parameter (&quot;tools/hdtoolbox 
  uaehf.device&quot;)</p>
<p><b><u>Add Harddrive...</u></b></p>
<p align="center"><img src="harddrive.gif" width="350" height="139"></p>
<p><br>
  You can now add complete Harddrives to Winuae, select from a dropdown list. 
  This list will only pick up Amiga formatted drives, Amithlon partitions and 
  empty partitions (not Windows partitions). Tick the <b>Read/Write</b> option 
  if you wish to read and write to such a partition.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Windows 2000/XP is required for this feature! You must 
  also possess administrator rights!</p>
<p><br>
  <b>Remove</b> removes a harddisk from the configuration. Simply select a harddisk 
  and click "Remove". <br>
  <br>
  <b>Properties</b> allows you to change the settings for your virtual HDD. To 
  adjust, click your desired HDD and select properties. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Add PC Drives at Startup</b> mounts all available PC drive-letters for the 
  Amiga to use except CD drives, using the following naming convention: <br>
  <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the drive-letter has a Windows volume-name associated with it, the drive 
    will get mounted in the Amiga using its volume-name. On PCs, the volume name 
    can be set via the Properties of the drive in My Computer.</li>
<li>If no volume-name, the drive gets assigned an Amiga volume-name based on its drive-type (the 'x:' 
is the PC drive-letter):</li> 
</ul>
<table border=2>
<tr><td>Hard Drives</td><td>WinDH_x:</td></tr>
<tr><td>CD-ROM Drives</td><td>  WinCD_x:</td></tr>
<tr><td>Floppy Drives</td><td> WinDF_x: </td></tr>
<tr><td>Network Drives</td><td> WinNW_x: </td></tr>
<tr><td>Removable Drives</td><td> WinRMV_x: </td></tr>
<tr><td>RAM Disk Drives</td><td> WinRAM_x: </td></tr>
</table>
<p><br>
  <br>
  NOTE: If a drive doesn't currently have a disc in it (floppy, CD-ROM, etc.), 
  then this option will NOT mount the drive for use by the Amiga. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Disable UAEFSDB Support </b> - This will disable the create of UAEFSDB files 
  which store extra information such as additional protection flags for files 
  when using Directory type of file systems.</p>
