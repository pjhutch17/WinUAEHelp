<p class="headline1">Hard Drives</p>
<p class="text">This tab contains some very important options, because you can
  configure harddisks for your &quot;Amiga&quot;.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="hdd.gif" alt="Winuae - Hard Drives"></p>
<p class="text">Since using diskfiles is awkward, it is necessary to emulate
  harddisks. There are two ways how you can use large amounts of data with UAE:
  harddisk files and mounted directories.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Add Directory...</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="hddir.gif" alt="WinUAE - Add Directory"></p>
<p class="text">Adds a virtual HDD to your Amiga. You can specify a path to your
  desired folder in Windows,a Volume name and a device name (usually DHx) which
  will be used for the hard drive in the emulation.</p>
<p class="text">This has some major advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">It has no problems with Kickstart 1.3 </li>
  <li class="text">It is more convenient. </li>
  <li class="text">It is much faster.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">You can also use native filesystems to mount Amiga CD-ROMs, and
  you can abuse the hardfile emulation to mount floppy disks.<br>
  If you have AmigaOS 3.9 CD you can boot from the <strong>Emergency-Boot</strong> directory
  to load Workbench (to read/write to it, copy the directory to your hard disk
  first and boot from that).</p>
<p class="text">If you have Cloanto's Amiga Forever, you can boot from the supplied
  shared directory in <strong>C:\Program Files\Cloanto\Amiga Forever\Emulation\Shared\<br>
  dir\System</strong> folder.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Add Hardfile...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="hardfile.gif" alt="Add Hardfile"></p>
<p class="text">With this dialog you can add a hardfile. If you want to use
  an existing file, just click the ... button opposite <strong>Path </strong>and
  select the hdf file. If you want to add a new file, specify the number of megabytes
  (MB) you want it to be then click on <strong>Create</strong>, then in the dialog
  box state where on your PC hard disk you want to save your file e.g. System.hdf.
  I suggest 50 MB or greater.<br>
  <br>
  Harddisk files are large files that contain the image of an Amiga filesystem.
  They work much the same way as a disk file. You can simply create a large empty
  file and tell UAE to use it as a hardfile, but you will need to format it from
  the emulation before you can actually use it. <br>
</p>
<p class="text">If you are want to boot a hardfile under Kickstart 1.3, you need
  the FastFileSystem file from the L: directory to be placed in the kickstart
  roms-directory where WinUAE is installed.<br>
  <br>
  If you are using WinUAE 0.8.22r1 or earlier and Kickstart 1.3 or earlier, hardfiles
  can't currently be mounted at boot time, and therefore you can't boot from
  it either. You will have to boot either from a <a href="floppies.htm"> Floppy
  Disk Image</a> or from a Filesystem, and mount the hardfile.device later. To
  do this, add the following to &quot;DEVS:mountlist&quot;: <br>
  <br>
  <em>UAE0:<br>
  Device = uaehf.device<br>
  Unit = 0<br>
  Flags = 0<br>
  Surfaces = 1<br>
  BlocksPerTrack = 32<br>
  Reserved = 1<br>
  Interleave = 0<br>
  LowCyl = 0 ; HighCyl = 511<br>
  Buffers = 5<br>
  DosType = 0x444F5300<br>
  BufMemType = 1<br>
  </em> <br>
  <br>
  You may need to adjust the values if you specified a different geometry, and/or
  your hardfile has a different size than 8MB, and/or the hardfile is not mounted
  as UAE0: because you mounted other harddisks before it. Then, type &quot;mount
  UAE0:&quot; (or put that command in your startup-sequence), and you should
  be able to access it. Don't forget to format it with the AmigaOS! </p>
<p class="text">If using HDToolbox to manage Hard files, then you must create
  hardfile normally or use harddisk image from your real Amiga but clear all<br>
  hardfile parameters except block size.(sectors, surfaces and reserved)</p>
<p class="text">HDToolBox must be run with &quot;uaehf.device&quot;-parameter
  (&quot;tools/hdtoolbox uaehf.device&quot;)</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Add Harddrive...</p>
<p align="center"><img src="harddrive.gif" alt="Add Harddrive"></p>
<p class="text"><br>
  You can now add complete Harddrives to WinUAE, select from a dropdown list.
    This list will only pick up Amiga formatted drives, Amithlon partitions and
    empty partitions (not Windows partitions). Tick the <strong>Read/Write</strong> option
    if you wish to read and write to such a partition.</p>
<p class="text"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Windows 2000/XP is required for this feature!
  You must also possess administrator rights!</p>
<p class="text"><strong>Remove</strong> removes a harddisk from the configuration.
  Simply select a harddisk and click &quot;Remove&quot;.</p>
<p class="text"><strong>Properties</strong> allows you to change the settings
  for your virtual HDD. To adjust, click your desired HDD and select properties.</p>
<p class="text"><strong>Add PC Drives at Startup</strong> mounts all available
  PC drive-letters for the Amiga to use except CD drives, using the following
  naming convention:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">If the drive-letter has a Windows volume-name associated with
    it, the drive will get mounted in the Amiga using its volume-name. On PCs,
    the volume name can be set via the Properties of the drive in My Computer.</li>
  <li class="text">If no volume-name, the drive gets assigned an Amiga volume-name
    based on its drive-type (the 'x:' is the PC drive-letter):</li>
</ul>
