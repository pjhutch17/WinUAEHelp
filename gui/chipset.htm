<u><b>Chipset</b></u>
<ul>
  <li><b>OCS</b> (Original Chip Set): This was the first Chipset, used in the 
    Amiga 1000. It consists of the chips Paula, Agnus, and Denise. With these, 
    you can display graphics in resolutions up to 640x512 and in up to 4096 colors. 
  </li>
  <li><b>ECS Agnus</b> Uses enhanced Fat Agnus which supplies 1Mb of Chip RAM.</li>
  <li><b>Full ECS</b> (Enhanced Chip Set): This was the next generation of Amiga 
    chipsets. The chip names remained unchanged, except some minor additions like 
    "Fat Agnus". Only Agnus and Denise were changed. Compared to OCS, they provided 
    higher resolutions, but no expansion of the color palette so far.</li>
  <li><b>AGA</b> (Advanced Graphics Architecture): This is the latest and most 
    advanced chipset. The current generation was created in the labs as AA chipset 
    (for Advanced Amiga), but in some countries it was later marketed as AGA (Advanced 
    Graphics Architecture). Agnus was replaced by Alice and Denise by Lisa. The 
    resolutions now reach up to 1280x512 in VGA scan frequencies. The color palette 
    is now 24 bits or 16.8 million colors. You can display up to 256 colors simultaneously 
    or in HAM mode more than 640,000. Backwards compatibility with Video and OCS 
    modes is assured.<br>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> AGA modes do not work with 8-bit color depth screen 
    modes!</li>
  <li><b>NTSC</b> Enables US NTSC screen mode (default is PAL).</li>
</ul>
<br>
For extra custom chip settings, select: 
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Fast Copper</b> is the short name for a "Coprocessor" which is integrated 
    into the Amiga custom chips. It makes fast action games possible, as well 
    as unbelievable color effects, and the capability to drag down a screen partially 
    on the Amiga's display and thus show several screens at once. Technically, 
    the Copper is a highly specialized microprocessor which knows only three different 
    commands, but can process these extremely fast and efficiently. It provides 
    the ability to change e.g. graphics mode, color values, or sprite definitions 
    somewhere at a well defined location within the screen. This way the Amiga 
    can display many different actions on one screen simultaneously without activity 
    by the main CPU.</li>
  <li><b>Immediate Blits</b>. The Blitter is the short name for another graphics 
    coprocessor which is part of the Amiga custom chips. With it you can copy 
    rectangular image parts extremely fast to other areas. During this, you can 
    take up to three source data areas and perform logical operations on them. 
    This allows e.g. to define certain color values of the copied object as transparent, 
    thus not modifying the destination area. As an add-on, the Blitter can also 
    draw lines and fill areas fast. All in all it serves to provide extremely 
    fast, animated graphics that can be designed to be especially realistic. </li>
  <li><b>Cycle exact CPU and Blitter.</b> This is an experimental feature to cycle 
    exact cpu and blitter emulation mode. Is slower than normal mode.</li>
</ul>
<u><b>Collision Level</b></u>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>None</b> No collision detection used.</li>
<li><b>Sprites Only</b> Collision detection between sprites only enabled.</li>
<li><b>Sprites and Sprites vs Playfield</b> Collison detection between Sprites and background graphics.</li>
<li><b>Full</b> enables all levels of collision detection.<br>
    <strong>HINT:</strong> Full is not recommended because it causes unnecessary 
    performance loss, and is just very rarely needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Sound Emulation</u></b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Disabled. </b>No sound</li>
  <li><b>Emulated.</b> Sound is emulated but not 100% accurate.</li>
  <li><b>Emulated. 100% accurate.</b> As accurate sound emulation as possible 
    but my use up more CPU time<br>
    <br>
