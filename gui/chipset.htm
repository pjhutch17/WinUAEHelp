<p class="text">This will select which custom chipset to use for emulation:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="chipset.gif" alt="Winuae - Chipset"></p>
<p class="headline2">Chipset type</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>OCS</strong> (Original Chip Set): This was the first
    Chipset, used in the Amiga 1000. It consists of the chips Paula, Agnus, and
    Denise. With these, you can display graphics in resolutions up to 640x512
    and in up to 4096 colors. </li>
  <li class="text"><strong>ECS Agnus</strong> Uses enhanced Fat Agnus which supplies
    1MB of Chip RAM.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Full ECS</strong> (Enhanced Chip Set): This was the
    next generation of Amiga chipsets. The chip names remained unchanged, except
    some minor additions like &quot;Fat Agnus&quot;. Only Agnus and Denise were
    changed. Compared to OCS, they provided higher resolutions, but no expansion
    of the color palette so far.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>AGA</strong> (Advanced Graphics Architecture): This
    is the latest and most advanced chipset. The current generation was created
    in the labs as AA chipset (for Advanced Amiga), but in some countries it
    was later marketed as AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture). Agnus was replaced
    by Alice and Denise by Lisa. The resolutions now reach up to 1280x512 in
    VGA scan frequencies. The color palette is now 24 bits or 16.8 million colors.
    You can display up to 256 colors simultaneously or in HAM mode more than
    640,000. Backwards compatibility with Video and OCS modes is assured.<br>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> AGA modes do not work with 8-bit color depth screen
    modes!</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>NTSC</strong> Enables US NTSC screen mode (default
    is PAL).</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Misc chipset options</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>Immediate Blitter</strong> Does requested blits immediately. 
    The Blitter serves to provide extremely fast, animated graphics that can be 
    designed to be especially realistic. </li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Cycle exact CPU and Blitter</strong> This is an experimental 
    feature to cycle exact cpu and blitter emulation mode. This is slower than 
    normal mode, and only necessary for a few games and demos.</li>
  <li><font size="+2"><b><font size="+1">Genlock Connected. </font></b><font size="+1">Detects 
    whether a Genlock is connected to PC.</font></font></li>
  <li><font size="+1"><b>Faster RTG. </b></font></li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Collision Level</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>None</strong> No collision detection used.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Sprites Only</strong> Collision detection between
    sprites only enabled.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Sprites and Sprites vs Playfield</strong> Collison
    detection between Sprites and background graphics.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Full</strong> enables all levels of collision detection.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>HINT:</strong> Full is not recommended because it causes unnecessary
    performance loss, and is just very rarely needed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Sound Emulation</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"><strong>Disabled. </strong>No sound</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Emulated.</strong> Sound is emulated but not 100%
    accurate.</li>
  <li class="text"><strong>Emulated. 100% accurate.</strong> As accurate
    as possible but may use up more CPU time<br>
    <br>
