<h2><u>Sound Settings</u></h2>
<br><br>
Here you can select, if (and how) UAE will provide sound emulation.

  <b>Sound device:</b>. Specify which sound card to use on your system.</p>
<p><b><u>Sound Emulation</u></b> <br>
  <br>
  <b>Disabled</b> causes UAE not to emulate sound. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Disabled, but emulated</b> tries to emulate most of the sound hardware, but 
  doesn't actually output sound. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Emulated</b> should sound just as good as 100% accurate and will be much 
  faster for some programs. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Emulated, 100% accurate</b> will emulate all of the sound hardware; and some 
  programs (i.e. AIBB) won't run with other settings. <br>
</p>
<p><b><u>Disk Drive Sound Emulation</u></b></p>
<p>This feature enables the Disk Drive sounds like on a real Amiga so you can 
  hear disks being read or written to. Select a drive and the Amiga emulation 
  mode to use (A500 by default). The slider is the volume.</p>
<p><b><u>Frequency, Sample Type and Stereo Mode</u></b> <br>
  <br>
  This options allow you to adjust the settings for the sound-sampling. The higher 
  Frequency and/or Sample Type, the higher will be the sound quality, but the 
  slower will be the emulation. The <b>Stereo mode</b> can be set to Mono, Stereo 
  or Mixed (either). Stereo will use more CPU time. <br>
  The <b>Audio Filter</b> allows you to emulate Sound Power LED and can be Always 
  on, Always off or Emulated.<br>
  <br>
  <b>NOTE:</b> High quality sound requires a lot of computing power, so try with 
  different settings if your machine is not fast enough. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Sound Buffering</b> <br>
  Gives you access to the level of the used Direct Sound buffer. You should play 
  with it if you get choppy sound. <br>
  Values can be from 1 to 7. <br>
  Also, you can set <b>Interpolation</b> on to smooth out sound but needs more 
  computing power. <br>
  Finally, you can compensate for 'sound lag' when sound becomes unsynchronised 
  with the system by adjusting the <b>Sound driver lag compensation </b>from -10% 
  to +3%.<br>
  <br>
  The <b>Calibrate </b>button will optimise the sound values for you to match 
  your PC.</p>
<p>Two new settings for <b>Stereo Seperation and Stereo mixing delay</b> can be 
  set to improve stereo sound.</p>
