<h2><u>Features</u></h2>
<br>
WinUAE is a very feature-rich implementation of an Amiga: <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Picasso96 RTG support, so that your Amiga can make use of all available 
    display modes of your PC graphics-card. P96-RTG is implemented as a Zorro-III 
    graphics-card to the Amiga.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>CD-ROM, CDTV and CD32 drive support, for accessing Amiga CD-ROM discs.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Windows file-system support, so that your Amiga can use your PC hard-drive's 
    file-system directly. Makes it easy to share files between Windows and the 
    Amiga.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Full Harddisk support, for maximum compatibility, and reduced risk. HDToolbox, 
    RDB and custom filesystems supported. Also, larger hard files supported above 
    2Gb especially with NTFS. Able to mount real hard disks with RDB and Amithlon 
    partitions. Kickstart 1.3 hardfiles now supported with FastFileSystem in KS 
    roms directory. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Zorro-III memory-expansion support, so that you can emulate up to 128-Megs 
    of RAM inside the Amiga.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Super-Alice custom-chip, with up to 8-Megs of Chip Memory.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Virtual networking support, through either your Ethernet or Dial-Up Networking 
    connection to the world.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>MIDI output support.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>JIT CPU emulation.</li>
  <br>
  <br>

    in Input-tab configuration.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Floppy disk speed slider and configurable floppy drive types.<br>
    <br>
    And many, many more! <br>
