1. Introduction
---------------
Welcome to the official help file for WinUAE! This has been designed to aid 
you in using WinUAE, and is integrated into the main WinUAE program.
This helpfile will give you information on how to get started with WinUAE, a 
description of all the GUI Settings, information about the emulation itself, 
and some additonal information about real Amigas in the Background 
Information section.
Experienced users can find valuable tips for better speed and functionality 
of WinUAE at the Hints For Power Users page.


2. Installation
