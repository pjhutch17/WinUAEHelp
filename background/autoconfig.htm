<h2><u>Autoconfig</u></h2>
On other computer systems you always had to configure cards manually via &quot;jumpers&quot; 
or DIP switches for certain address areas or interrupt numbers. This is very tedious 
and, in practice, it requires in-depth knowledge of the system to avoid conflicts 
among different cards used simultaneously. The Autoconfig mechanism of the Amiga 
system automates this procedure totally, so that the user never has to bother 
with such details. Thus, expanding an Amiga system is extremely simple and without 
problems.
