<p class="headline1">Autoconfig</p>
<p class="text">On other computer systems you always had to configure cards manually
  via &quot;jumpers&quot; or DIP switches for certain address areas or interrupt
  numbers. This is very tedious and, in practice, it requires in-depth knowledge
  of the system to avoid conflicts among different cards used simultaneously.
  AutoConfig was introduced with the Amiga 1000 in the year 1987, and automated
  this procedure totally, so that the user never had to bother with such details.
  An equivalent of this technology - called Plug and Play - was released by Microsoft
  with the introduction of Windows 95. </p>
<p class="text">When the Amiga is switched on, the Kickstart begins to search
  for an expansion card every expansion slot. When a card is found, information
  about its type and needed resources is read out of that card. The Kickstart
  then automatically allocates all necessary resources. The important difference
  to Plug and Play is that Amigas already allocate all expansions before the
  operating system is loaded. On Windows machines, the operating system itself
  searches and invokes expansion cards. AutoConfig is, regarding to that, similar
  to Plug and Play in the sense of the word, although the mechanism is different.</p>
