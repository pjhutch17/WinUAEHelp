<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">What is an Amiga?</p>
<p class="text">Amigas come in two variaties: the all-in-one console type with keyboard, a 
  floppy drive in right hand side and ports at the back (like a large C64). There 
  is the standard Desktop type like PCs. Amigas run AmigaOS with Workbench as 
  the interface (similar to W95 but no Start button) with menus on the screen 
  title bar and list of drive volumes down the side. Amigas use the Motorola 680x0 
  series processor, and have their own custom Chipset (Agnus|Alice, Paula, Denise|Lisa, 
  Gary etc) which looks after graphics, sound, I/O and boots off a Kickstart ROM 
  (like BIOS on the PC). The Amiga was THE most popular home computer in the late 
  80s and early 90s before Commodore Business Machines went bust in 1993. Gateway 
  2000/Amiga Inc now own the Amiga.</p>

<p class="headline3">Where can I get the latest UAE?</p>
<p class="text">Please refer to the <a href="../links.htm">links page</a> to find official UAE sites.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Where can I get the Kickstart ROM and Workbench disks?</p>
<p class="text">Original disks can be purchased from <a href="http://www.amigaforever.com/osmedia/">Cloanto</a> 
  or <a href="http://www.amigadeals.fsnet.co.uk/adutilities.htm">AmigaDeals</a>.</p>
<p class="headline4">Kickstart</p>
<p class="text">The Kickstart is a ROM chip which contains essential parts of the Operating System 
  and an Amiga cannot boot without it.</p>
<p class="text">A copy of the kickstart can be copied from your Amiga using the <a href="../started/transrom.htm">TransRom utility</a>.<br>
  Kickstarts are supplied on the <strong>Amiga Forever</strong> CD in <em>\Emulation\shared\</em>ROM.<br>
If you have the <strong>Amiga Classix CD</strong>, you can find a Kickstart 1.3 ROM file on it.</p>
<p class="headline4">Workbench</p>
<p class="text"> Use the <a href="../started/transdisk.htm">TransDisk program</a> to create ADF images of WB disks.<br>
  The Workbench is the Amiga's User Interface to manage files and start applications.<br>
  Why not try my Freeware UAEBench disks (KS2.0+) if you don't have a WB disk.<br>
  A larger set of Workbench disks (up to 3.1) can be found on the <strong>Amiga Forever</strong> CD in <em>\Emulation\shared\ADF</em> and a full Workbench directory hard disk 
    set up in <em>\Emulation\shared\dir</em>.<br>
  Workbench or <strong>AmigaOS 3.5</strong> or <strong>3.9</strong> CD can be purchased from any good 
    Amiga dealer (for example <a href="http://www.softhut.com">Software Hut</a> or <a href="http://www.powerc.com">Power Computing</a>) and can be read directly 
on a PC as a Read Only Directory based Hard Disk on WinUAE.<br>
  If you have WB 2.0 or better, try ADF Blitzer, which has a nice Workbench frontend!</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">How can I transfer data FROM/TO an Amiga using a network?</p>
<p class="text">You can try <a href="http://cloanto.com/amiga/explorer/">Cloanto</a>'s Amiga 
  Explorer which does not require a program on Amiga side to start off with!<br>
  Download <a href="http://amiga.nvg.org/warlock/wartrans/">WarTrans</a> which 
  works with AmigaBasic and a program on PC side.<br>
  You can use <a href="http://www.emulatorsunlimited.co.uk/AMIPCLinkup.htm">AmiPCLinkUp</a> 
which a professional network software setup.</p>
<p class="text">Kickstart ROMs and Workbench are COPYRIGHTED by Amiga Inc and it is ILLEGAL to 
  distribute them or download them from unauthorised sites. For real Workbench 
  disks, you can get replacements from <a href="http://www.amiga.com/">Amiga Inc.</a>, <a href="http://www.softhut.com" target="_top">SoftHut (US)</a>. <a href="http://www.weirdscience.co.uk/products/workbench/amigaos39.shtml">Weird 
  Science</a>, <a href="http://www.eyetech.co.uk" target="_top">Eyetech</a> and <a href="http://www.powerc.com" target="_top"> Power Computing</a> from &pound;9.95 
  and from old Amiga magazine CDs and <a href="http://home.t-online.de/home/r.benda/soft2.html">R. 
  Brenda's CBM Page</a> (legal).</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Can a PC read Amiga floppy disks?</p>
<p class="text">Yes, if you have two floppy drives and the new <a href="http://www.oldskool.org/disk2fdi/">Disk2FDI</a> program which will read Amiga Disks and write it to FDI format which is<br>
  compatible with WinUAE.<br>
  For the PC to read Amiga disks directly, extra hardware will need to be purchased 
  which can read (or write) Amiga disks easily. The ISA Catweasel floppy controller 
  can be used on the PC to read (or write) Amiga disks. Further information is 
  available from the web site at <a href="http://www.jschoenfeld.com/indexe.htm" target="_top">Individual 
  Computers</a>.<br>
  Finally, if these options are not feasible, why not buy a real Amiga second 
  hand for those occasions when you want to transfer files and you'll have access 
  to a real KS and WB for use on your main machine.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">What are ADFs, ADZ, LHA, LZX, DMS, ZIP and Z files?</p>
<p class="text">An ADF is an image of an Amiga disk, so that the long filenames, comments, and 
  flags are kept. The ADFs have to be copied to PC formatted disks to be read 
  on the Amiga. ADZ files are GZIP'd ADF files. You need GZIP.EXE to access the 
  original ADF files. Keeping them GZIP'd will save space and WinUAE can extract 
  them automatically.<br>
  LHA is the common file archive format on the Amiga, Aminet uses it a lot as 
  well as DMS (Disk Masher) which is a disk archive format. You can use DMS, xDMS 
  or ADFOpus to extract or convert DMS archives to ADF. You need LHA and LZX programs 
  to archive or unarchive files. For example, to unarchive a lha file, type <em>LHA 
  X GAME.LHA</em> to extract the files to the current directory. To make an archive, 
  type <em>LHA A GAME.LHA GameDir/#?</em> which will add all files in GameDir to 
  GAME.LHA. To list files, type <em>LHA L GAME.LHA</em>.<br>
  If using LHA on the PC with Amiga lha files, use the <strong>/ax</strong> options to allow 
  the files to be extracted properly. LZX is a newer faster and more compact archiver 
  than LHA and requires the LZX program to extract them. All these unarchivers 
  are available from Aminet. Try the W95 UnLZX program to extract LZX files on 
  your PC.<br>
  Amigas can also handle the common ZIP format using the ZIP and UNZIP commands 
  (equivalent to PKZIP and PKUNZIP on the PC). The Amiga version of the unix GZIP 
  format can handle .Z and .ADZ files.<br>
  You can download all the Amiga (de)archivers from here: Amiga Archivers for 
  use within WinUAE or try <a href="http://de.aminet.net/pub/aminet/util/arc/X-Arc.lha">X-Arc</a> for use in Workbench.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Can I convert ADFs back into Amiga disks?</p>
<p class="text">Yes, that is possible. You can use the TransDisk command e.g. <em>transdisk -w 
  mydisk.adf</em> which will write the image to DF0: and there are some other programs 
  available such as ADF2DISK, ADF2FMS, ADFBLITZER which are available on Aminet 
  (see above for links) in disk/misc.<br>
  Disks are sometimes created with DMS (DiskMasher) which be converted to files 
  or ADFs using xDMS Unpacker.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">How can I speed up graphics output?</p>
<p class="text">Emulating the OCS, ECS or AGA chipset is slow, instead, you can use the PC's 
  graphics card instead to output graphics and use 256 or more colours. Try using the latest <a href="../emulation/picasso.htm">Picasso96</a> software instead.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Can I emulate a Hard Disk on the Emulator?</p>
<p class="text">Yes, that is possible. For more information see <a href="../gui/hard-drives.htm">Hard disk setup</a>.<br>
  It is possible to read an Amiga formatted harddisk directly by using <a href="http://www.linux.com" target="_top">Linux</a> and the AFFS 1.3 file system.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Can I access Amiga CDs via the Emulator?</p>
<p class="text">Yes, Amiga CDs use the same filesystem for CDs as the PC (i.e. ISO9660), except 
  for the fact that it uses the Rock Ridge extension for long filenames.<br>
  There are two ways to access Amiga CD disks: insert the CD into your CD drive, 
  on the Hard Drive screen of WinUAE, click 'Add Directory' and then enter the 
  volume name of the CD and the drive letter of the CD ROM drive e.g. <em>D:</em>. Use the <a href="../started/amigados.htm">diskchange</a> command in the CLI if you 
  change CDs (type <strong>Info</strong> for list of devices).<br>
  With WinUAE 0.8.21 or later you can install the CDROM drivers from either AmigaOS3.9 
  CD or a third party driver such as<br>
  AmiCDFS. You need to enable <strong>uaescsi.device</strong> on the <a href="../gui/misc.htm">Misc tab</a> before 
  starting WinUAE and enable <strong>logging</strong> to determine the unit<br>
  numbers (see <em>winuaelog.txt<strong> </strong></em>file) for your CD-ROM drive. When you 
  install the drive make sure the device is uaescsi.device and the unit numbers 
  match the unit numbers in the log file.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">What limitations can I expect from using WinUAE?</p>
<p class="text">An emulator can not fully emulate everything on the Amiga as it has to emulate 
  the CPU and the Custom Chipset and all other special hardware. The latest versions of WinUAE will try to use buffers for sound to 
  improve output and JIT for extra CPU speed, chipset graphics is improving but 
  256 colours can be very slow due to the Amiga's bitmap system of using multiple 
  layers. Using Picasso96 emulation can improve graphics a lot, use that wherever 
possible.<br>
Emulators are improved all the time, so keep an eye out for new versions. Sound 
    emulation can depend on your processor as well, turning it off will improve 
    emulation speed though.<br>
  It can not use the MMU on higher 680x0 
  processors. This means that programs that require 
  Memory Management such as Linux or Virtual Memory will not work in WinUAE.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">How do I create a blank disk for saving files or games?</p>
<p>For WinUAE, goto <strong>Floppies</strong> tab and click on 'Create Blank Floppy' button 
    in 0.8.8 or click 'Create Standard Floppy' for use in Workbench or use 'Create 
    Custom Floppy' for some games to save files to.<br>
  For specific save game disks visit <a href="http://www.back2roots.org/Games/Savedisks/" target="_top"> 
  Back 2 Roots - Savedisks</a>.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I have all my floppy drives full how do I change disks?</p>
<p class="text">Press END key and either F1, F2, F3, F4 to do a disk change.<br>
  Using SHIFT+END and F1-F4 will eject the disk.<br>
  You can also press F12 for the setup screen and select Floppy to change the 
disk while its running.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>  
<p class="headline3"> How do I save the current &quot;State&quot; of a game?</p>
<p class="text">On WinUAE 0.8.17 or later you can now save the current state by pressing F12, 
  go to the Misc screen and click 'Save current state'<br>
  which will save the state as a .USS file. Use 'Load a save-state snapshot' to 
  load state file. You will need as much disk space as<br>
  memory allocated to the Amiga.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">What do I need to network my Amiga and PC?</p>
<p class="text">If you do not have Crossdos or MSH installed on your Amiga, a serial network 
  is needed to transfer files between them instead of via floppy. All you need 
  is the following items:<br>
  a) Terminal software for Amiga and PC, preferably ones than can do Binary Transfers 
  using common protocols such as Kermit and X/Y/ZModem. Amiga term programs include 
  NComm, JRComm, and Term. PC term programs include Terminal and Terminus.<br>
  A commonly used program called Twin Express can be used instead or <em>PC2Ami</em> or <a href="http://www.ntware.com/workstation/terminal.html">AmigaTrans</a> or <a href="http://cloanto.com/amiga/explorer/">Amiga Explorer</a> from Cloanto.<br>
  b) A serial cable with 9pin end for PC and 25 pin end for Amiga. It has to be 
  a null-modem cable which means that lines 2 and 3 have to cross over to receive/transmit 
  between peers and line 7 for control signals.<br>
  c) Connect the computers with serial lead and load up the software on each end.<br>
  d) Start binary receive on one end using one of the protocols common to both 
  programs.<br>
  e) Start binary transmit on the other and load the file to be transmitted, it 
  should then transfer to the other end in seconds/minutes depending on size.<br>

<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Why should I buy Amiga Forever CD or AF Online?</p>
<p class="text">Unless you have access to a real Amiga, or have bought a Kickstart and Workbench 
  disks, there is no other legal way of getting the OS for your emulation. The 
  software is the property of Amiga Inc and only they can licence it to companies. 
  Cloanto, have a licence, to distribute Amiga Emulation with Kickstart rom files 
  and Workbench images from CD or from their web site. The CD also includes some 
  popular Amiga Software, a complete Workbench hard disk setup, MPEG videos of 
  Jay Miner's speech and the Deathbed Vigil (last days of Commodore), Amiga Explorer 
  network program etc.<br>
  For easy access you can download the online version for as little as $20, you 
  get Kickstart and Workbench 1.3 and 3.0, PPaint 7.1, an easy setup menu system, 
  Amiga Explorer and the Emulation programs themselves. These would cost a lot 
  more if bought seperately. For beginners, it is ideal to set up an Amiga on 
  your PC within minutes than having to search the web for them and fiddle with 
  setups to get it to work!<br>

    Forever</a>.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Can I access the Internet through WinUAE?</p>
<p class="text">That is possible. You can through the PC's Internet connection by enabling the <strong>BSD socket library support</strong> feature on the MISC page of WinUAE configuration. 
    Make sure you go on line before loading WinUAE.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I cannot install AmigaOS 3.5, it crashes during main install?</p>
<p class="text">Try changing the Sound options to better level e.g. 16 bit and 44.1 Hz and change 
  the CPU settings to adjustable and to level 1. Alternatively, edit out references 
  to playing sounds (such as the clapping noise) in the Installer script (if you 
  know what you are doing).<br>
  There is no need to create an Emergency disk as this will not work under emulation 
  but booting off any Workbench ADF would be sufficient to install AmigaOS 3.5 
  or 3.9.<br>
  There is an update available for AmigaOS 3.9 called a Boing Bag and to get it 
  to install on WinUAE you need a patch available from <a href="http://www.amiga.com/3.9">Amiga Inc</a>.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">How can I make or see inside ADF files without using an emulator?</p>
<p class="text">You need <a href="http://www.zipworld.com.au/~gharris/adfopus.html" target="_top">ADFOpus</a> or <a href="http://home.worldonline.dk/viksoe/adfview.htm">ADFView</a> which 
    will allow you to create and explore and manipulate the contents of Amiga Disk 
    Format images easily. ADFOpus also features a DMS-ADF-ADZ image converter as 
    well.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I am having problems running some programs or games using WinUAE</p>
<p class="text">First make sure your UAE configuration matches the game's requirements. Very 
  old games depend on specific versions of Kickstart, processor and memory. See 
  list of Amiga specs to see what configurations to try. If you still have problems
  then download <a href="http://jffabre.free.fr/amiga/patches.html">JST</a> or
  <a href="http://www.whdload.de/">WHDLoad</a>, which can degrade the 
  Amiga to such a state that the program will run correctly.<br>
  Also, try using Fellow or WinFellow as an alternative emulator to run the game.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I have installed Windows XP Home Edition but WinUAE now crashes?</p>
<p class="text">You need to run older versions of WinUAE in Compatibility Mode. Find WinUAE.exe 
  and select it, press right mouse button and select <strong>Properties</strong>, select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab and change the Compatibility mode to <strong>Windows 98/Windows 
    Me</strong> and tick 'Disable Windows themes'. WinUAE should now load. For Amiga 
    Forever 4 users, the setup will crash, please download latest version of WinUAE 
    (see above) and install that, alternatively get Amiga Forever 5.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Where can I download a good Workbench set up from with useful programs?</p>
<p>Get Amiga In a Box from <a href="http://aiab.emuunlim.com/">AIAB</a> which includes 
  Scalos (Workbench replacement), MUI 3.8, Picasso96, NewIcons, VisualPrefs, MCP, 
  MUI tools and Screentab. There are addons for Music, Internet, Languages and 
Shapeshifter.</p> 
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">When I run WinUAE, I get an error DINPUT8.DLL not found?</p>
<p>You need <a href="../links.htm">DirectX 8</a> or later 
  installed. Run DXDiag.exe to see what version you have installed.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">How do I create a bootable floppy (real or ADF)?</p>
<p class="text">Boot off your Workbench disk, insert a floppy disk in DF1:, open a command 
  Shell and type <strong>Install DF1:</strong> which will copy the book block on to the 
  disk. Then type <strong>MakeDir DF1:S</strong> to create the Script directory. Copy your 
  program file(s) on the disk, preferably root or use directories if you wanted 
  to. Then change directory to DF1:S and type <strong>Ed Startup-sequence</strong> and type 
  in commands to load your program, usually just the name of the Program file 
  will do. Test the disk, by inserting the disk into DF0: and Reboot the Amiga.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I have a Workbench disk but no Install disk, how do I install Workbench?</p>
<p class="text">You can download UAEInstall.adf disk which has some AmigaDOS or Installer scripts 
  to install Workbench for most Workbenchs incl 1.3 to 3.1.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Is there an emulator for the AmigaOne or PPC processor?</p>
<p class="text">There is no emulator for the AmigaOne at the moment. There is a PPC emulator 
  for x86 systems from <a href="http://www.pearpc.net/">PearPC</a>.<br>
