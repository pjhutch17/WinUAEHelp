<p class="headline3">0. What is an Amiga?</p>
<p class="text">Amigas come in two variaties: the all-in-one console type with keyboard, a 
  floppy drive in right hand side and ports at the back (like a large C64). There 
  is the standard Desktop type like PCs. Amigas run AmigaOS with Workbench as 
  the interface (similar to W95 but no Start button) with menus on the screen 
  title bar and list of drive volumes down the side. Amigas use the Motorola 680x0 
  series processor, and have their own custom Chipset (Agnus|Alice, Paula, Denise|Lisa, 
  Gary etc) which looks after graphics, sound, I/O and boots off a Kickstart ROM 
  (like BIOS on the PC). The Amiga was THE most popular home computer in the late 
  80s and early 90s before Commodore Business Machines went bust in 1993. Gateway 
  2000/Amiga Inc now own the Amiga.</p>

<p class="headline3">2. Where can I get the Kickstart ROM and Workbench disks?</p>
<p><span class="text">Original disks can be purchased from <a href="http://www.amigaforever.com/osmedia/">Cloanto</a> 
  or <a href="http://www.amigadeals.fsnet.co.uk/adutilities.htm">AmigaDeals</a>.<br>
  <span class="headline4">Kickstart</span>
<p>The Kickstart is a ROM chip contains essential parts of the Operating System 
  and an Amiga cannot boot without it.<br>
  A copy of the kickstart can be copied from your Amiga using the <strong>TransRom</strong> 
  utility (see below).<br>
  Kickstarts are supplied on the <strong>Amiga Forever</strong> CD in <i>D:\Emulation\shared\</i>ROM.<br>
  If you have the <strong>Amiga Classix CD</strong>, you can find a Kickstart 1.3 rom file.<br>
  <br>
  I) Getting a KickStart image using Transrom:<br>
  <br>
  a) Copy TransRom from the Tools dir that came with Winuae, to a 720k formatted 
  floppy.<br>
  b) Insert floppy disk into Amiga and copy Transrom into C: directory. (Assuming 
  you have MSH or Crossdos to read PC disk else use a serial network and transfer 
  it)<br>
  c) Assuming you have enough disk space/ram, type <i>Transrom &gt;kick.rom</i> 
  in a Shell to create a 256K or 512k rom image called kick.rom.<br>
  d) Copy kick.rom image back to PC floppy disk (or use serial n/w) e.g Copy kick.rom 
  to PC0:<br>
  e) Copy kick.rom image to Winuae directory from floppy on your PC!<br>
</p>
<p><strong>b) Workbench</strong></p>
<p> The Workbench is the Amiga's User Interface to manage files and start application 
  programs.<br>
  Why not try my Freeware UAEBench disks (KS2.0+) or my WB1.3 Boot disk (KS1.3) 
  if you don't have a WB disk. Also, try out my UAEInstall disk to set up Hard 
  Disks using HDInstTools (HDToolbox type program).<br>
  A larger set Workbenchs (upto 3.1) can be found on the <strong>Amiga Forever</strong> 
  CD in <i>D:\Emulation\shared\ADF</i> and a full Workbench directory hard disk 
  set up in <i>D:\Emulation\shared\dir</i>. <br>
  Workbench or <strong>AmigaOS 3.5</strong> or <strong>3.9</strong> CD can be purchased from any good 
  Amiga dealer (for example <a href="http://www.softhut.com">Software Hut</a> 
  or <a href="http://www.powerc.com">Power Computing</a> and can be read directly 
  on a PC as a Read Only Directory based Hard Disk on Winuae. </p>
<p><br>
  II) Using Transdisk to transfer disk images:<br>
  <br>
  Use the TransDisk program to create ADF images of WB disks.<br>
  e.g. <i>TransDisk &gt;ram:mydisk.adf</i> will create a 900k disk image file 
  in RAM: of the disk in DF0:. You can use Zip or Gzip to compress the file down 
  and then can be copied onto a 720K PC formatted disk to be directly read on 
  the PC using CrossDos or MSH (or use a Serial Network from the Amiga to PC to 
  transfer it directly).<br>
  <br>
  If you are low on memory (512K), then you will need to copy the disk in chunks 
  of a few tracks (0-79) of the disk. e.g.<br>
  Transdisk -s 0 -e 30 &gt;mydisk1.adf<br>
  Transdisk -s 31 -e 60 &gt;mydisk2.adf<br>
  Transdisk -s 61 -e 79 &gt;mydisk3.adf<br>
  then you can transfer them to the PC and then join the files together:<br>
  <i>Copy /B mydisk1.adf+mydisk2.adf+mydisk3.adf mydisk.adf</i> to create the 
  full 900K file.<br>
  <br>
  If you have WB 2.0 or better, try <a href="files/a????U???˜Ÿi?˜?˜†????????????????????††???????????†?†????????????????????????????†????????????????????????????????????????????†????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????††???????????????????????????????°????????††?????????????†††?????†††††††††††††††††???????????†††???????7??????††††???????????????????????????????????????††††?????????????†????????????????????†??????????????????????††††??????????????††††?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????††††??††??††?????†††??????????????†???†????††††††††††††?????????????†???????????????????????????††?????????†††??????????????????????????????????????????????††††?????????????????????????????††††???????????????????????????††??††????????????????????????††???????7?????????††?????????????????????????????????†??†????††††????????†††††?????????????????†††??????????????????????????????????†††???†??†????????????††??????????????????†??????????????††????????†††††††††††††??????????†††????????????†††††††††??????†††???????????????????††?????????????????†††????????????????????????????????†??????††?????????????????????????????????4??????†††???????????????????????????????????†††????†††††††††††††††††????????††??†††?????????????††??????????????????????†????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????†?????????????????????††?????????????†???????????????††?????°?????????????????††??????????????????????????????????????????????????††????????†?????????????????????????????????
dfblitzer.lha">ADF Blitzer</a> program which has a nice Workbench frontend!<br>
  <br>
  III) Using a network to transfer files to/from Amiga.</p>
<p>You can try <a href="http://cloanto.com/amiga/explorer/">Cloanto</a>'s Amiga 
  Explorer which does not require a program on Amiga side to start off with!<br>
  Download <a href="http://amiga.nvg.org/warlock/wartrans/">WarTrans</a> which 
  works with AmigaBasic and a program on PC side.<br>
  You can use <a href="http://www.emulatorsunlimited.co.uk/AMIPCLinkup.htm">AmiPCLinkUp</a> 
  which a professional network software setup.<br>
</p>

  Kickstart ROMs and Workbench are COPYRIGHT of Amiga Inc and it is ILLEGAL to 
  distribute them or download them from unauthorised sites. For real Workbench 
  disks, you can get replacements from <a href="http://www.amiga.com/">Amiga Inc.</a>,

  <br>
  <strong>3. Where can I get Amiga software from?</strong><br>
  <br>
  You can try the following:<br>
  a) <a href="http://de.aminet.net/" target="_top">Aminet (Ger.)</a> or <a href="http://us.aminet.net" target="_top">Aminet 
  US</a> has the biggest collection of software which includes loads of utilities, 
  demos, drivers, pictures, MODs and games which are freely available. You will 
  need the LHA program from util/arc to extract the archives.<br>
  <br>
  b) Compact Discs. UAE should be able to directly access these via <i>D:</i> 
  drive.<br>
  Good discs to look out for are <strong>Amiga Classix</strong> for games, the Aminet series 
  and Magazine cover disks. Some OS files can be found on some old magazine cover 
  disks.<br>
  <br>
  c) Floppy disks. You need to either archive the files (using LHA or ZIP) onto 
  a PC formatted disk on a real Amiga or use the <strong>TransDisk</strong> program to create 
  .ADF image files readable on a PC or <strong>Disk2FDI</strong> if you have 2 floppy drives. 
  You may use <strong>CrossDos </strong>by Consultron (Version 7 avail from Software Hut) 
  on WB2.1 or better or <i>MSH</i> (MessyDos) to access PC disks on the Amiga. 
  MSH is available on <a href="http://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/aminet/misc_????U???˜???˜?˜†????????????????????††???????????†?†????????????????????????????†????????????????????????????????????????????†????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????††???????????????????????????????°????????††?????????????†††?????†††††††††††††††††???????????†††???????7??????††††???????????????????????????????????????††††?????????????†????????????????????†??????????????????????††††??????????????††††?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????††††??††??††?????†††??????????????†???†????††††††††††††?????????????†???????????????????????????††?????????†††??????????????????????????????????????????????††††?????????????????????????????††††???????????????????????????††??††????????????????????????††???????7?????????††?????????????????????????????????†??†????††††????????†††††?????????????????†††??????????????????????????????????†††???†??†????????????††??????????????????†??????????????††????????†††††††††††††??????????†††????????????†††††††††??????†††???????????????????††?????????????????†††????????????????????????????????†??????††?????????????????????????????????4??????†††???????????????????????????????????†††????†††††††††††††††††????????††??†††?????????????††??????????????????????†????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????†?????????????????????††?????????????†???????????????††?????°?????????????????††??????????????????????????????????????????????????††????????†?????????????????????????????????

  <strong>4. Can a PC read Amiga floppy disks?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Yes, if you have two floppy drives and the new <a href="http://www.oldskool.org/disk2fdi/">Disk2FDI</a> 
  program which will read Amiga Disks and write it to FDI format which is<br>
  compatible with the latest Winuae program.<br>
  <br>
  You can only transfer files to PC formatted disks using CrossDos or <a href="http://de.aminet.net/pub/aminet/misc/emu/msh-156.lha">MSH</a> 
  on an Amiga. Alternatively, you can transfer files between an Amiga and PC through 
  Comms programs. e.g. JRComm, NComm, Term on the Amiga and the equiv. on the 
  PC eg HyperTerminal (see 14). Alternatively, you can use AmigaTran, or <a href="http://www.amigaforever.com/">Amiga 
  Explorer</a> (with Amiga Forever package).<br>
  <br>
  For the PC to read Amiga disks directly, extra hardware will need to be purchased 
  which can read (or write) Amiga disks easily. The ISA Catweasel floppy controller 
  can be used on the PC to read (or write) Amiga disks. Further information is 
  available from the web site at <a href="http://www.jschoenfeld.com/indexe.htm" target="_top">Individual 
  Computers</a> or email <a href="mailto:sysop@nostigic.tng.oche.de" target="_top">him</a>. 
  Also, see review in Amiga Format No 116 (Nov 98) p.58.<br>
  Finally, if these options are not feasible, why not buy a real Amiga second 
  hand for those occasions when you want to transfer files and you'll have access 
  to a real KS and WB for use on your main machine. You can get one really cheap 
  for less than &pound;50 via <a href="http://www.amibench.com/">Amibench</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>5. What are ADFs, ADZ, LHA, LZX, DMS, ZIP and Z files?</strong><br>
  <br>
  An ADF is an image of an Amiga disk, so that the long filenames, comments, and 
  flags are kept. The ADFs have to be copied to PC formatted disks to be read 
  on the Amiga. ADZ files are GZIP'd ADF files. You need GZIP.EXE to access the 
  original ADF files. Keeping them GZIP'd will save on space and Winuae can extract 
  them automatically.<br>
  LHA is the common file archive format on the Amiga, Aminet uses it a lot as 
  well as DMS (Disk Masher) which is a disk archive format. You can use DMS, xDMS 
  or ADFOpus to extract or convert DMS archives to ADF. You need LHA and LZX programs 
  to archive or unarchive files. For example, to unarchive a lha file, type <i>LHA 
  X GAME.LHA</i> to extract the files to the current directory. To make an archive, 
  type <i>LHA A GAME.LHA GameDir/#?</i> which will add all files in GameDir to 
  GAME.LHA. To list files, type <i>LHA L GAME.LHA</i>.<br>
  If using LHA on the PC with Amiga lha files, use the <strong>/ax</strong> options to allow 
  the files to be extracted properly. LZX is a newer faster and more compact archiver 
  than LHA and requires the LZX program to extract them. All these unarchivers 
  are available from Aminet. Try the W95 UnLZX program to extract LZX files on 
  your PC.<br>
  Amigas can also handle the common ZIP format using the ZIP and UNZIP commands 
  (equivalent to PKZIP and PKUNZIP on the PC). The Amiga version of the unix GZIP 
  format can handle .Z and .ADZ files.<br>
  You can download all the Amiga (de)archivers from here: Amiga Archivers for 
  use within Winuae or try <a href="http://de.aminet.net/pub/aminet/util/arc/X-Arc.lha">X-Arc</a> 
  for use in Workbench.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>6. Can I convert ADFs back into Amiga disks?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Yep, that is possible. You can use the TransDisk command e.g. <i>transdisk -w 
  mydisk.adf</i> which will write the image to DF0: and there are some other programs 
  available such as ADF2DISK, ADF2FMS,ADFBLITZER which are available on Aminet 
  (see above for links) in disk/misc.<br>
  Disks are sometimes created with DMS (DiskMasher) which be converted to files 
  or ADFs using xDMS Unpacker.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>7. How can I speed up graphics output?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Emulating the OCS, ECS or AGA chipset is slow, instead, you can use the PC's 
  graphics card instead to output graphics and use 256 or more colours. Download 
  the latest Picasso96 software from Aminet (version 1.32 or better) and use the 
  UAE driver supplied with it. Make sure Full Screen RTG is enabled and at least 
  2Mb of RTG (graphics card) ram is available.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>8. Can I emulate a Hard Disk on the Emulator?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Yes, that is possible. You can either specify a <i>directory</i> on the PC's 
  hard disk e.g. C:\UAE\AmigaHD or you can specify a <i>hard file</i>. The advantage 
  of a directory is that you can copy files directly from the PC site into the 
  directory for immediate access by the Emulator. For hard files you can use the 
  Amiga's long filenames, file comments and protection flags. For a hard disk 
  to be bootable, make sure you copy the whole Workbench disk including hidden 
  directories. Some programs work better with Hard Files than directories.<br>
  For more information see <a href="uae_hd.html">Hard disk setup</a>.<br>
  It is possible to read an Amiga formatted harddisk directly by using <a href="http://www.linux.com" target="_top">Linux</a> 
  and the AFFS 1.3 file system. It may be possible to read Amiga hard disks using 
  <a href="http://www.viksoe.dk/adfview/">ADF View</a> but backup the RDB and 
  Data first as it may render the disk <i>unusable</i> on the Amiga after using 
  it on the PC!<br>
  <br>
  <strong>9. Can I access Amiga CDs via the Emulator?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Yes, Amiga CDs use the same filesystem for CDs as the PC i.e. ISO9660 except 
  that it uses the Rock Ridge extension for long filenames.<br>
  <br>
  There are two ways to access Amiga CD disks: insert the CD into your CD drive, 
  on the Hard Drive screen of Winuae, click 'Add Directory' and then enter the 
  volume name of the CD and the drive letter of the CD ROM drive e.g. D: (without 
  the slash). Use the <strong>Diskchange &lt;device&gt;</strong> command in a Shell if you 
  change CDs (type <strong>Info</strong> for list of devices).<br>
  <br>
  With Winuae 0.8.21 or later you can install the CDROM drivers from either AmigaOS3.9 
  CD or a third party driver such as<br>
  AmiCDFS. You need to enable <strong>uaescsi.device</strong> on the <strong>Misc </strong>tab before 
  starting Winuae and enable <strong>Logging</strong> to determine the Unit<br>
  numbers (see <i>winuaelog.txt<strong> </strong></i>file) for your CDROM drive. When you 
  install the drive make sure the device is uaescsi.device and the unit numbers 
  match the unit numbers in the log file.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>10. What limitations can I expect from using an Emulator?</strong><br>
  <br>
  An emulator cannot fully emulate everything on the Amiga as it has to emulate 
  the CPU and the Custom Chipset chips as well as performance suffers on slow 
  machines. The latest versions of Winuae will try to use buffers for sound to 
  improve output and JIT for extra CPU speed, Chipset graphics is improving but 
  256 colours can be very slow due to the Amiga's bitmap system of using multiple 
  layers. Using Picasso 96 emulation can improve graphics a lot, use that wherever 
  possible.</p>
<p>Emulators are improved all the time, so keep an eye out for new versions. Sound 
  emulation can depend on your processor as well, turning it off will improve 
  emulation speed though.<br>
  <br>
  It cannot do sprite-playfield collisions or use the MMU on higher spec'd 680x0 
  processors. This means that in some games the will not play correctly do to 
  the way tricks are used to find character hits. Also, programs that require 
  Memory Management such as Linux or Virtual Memory will not work in Winuae.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>11. How do I create a blank disk for saving files or games?</strong><br>
  <br>
  For WinUAE, goto <strong>Floppies</strong> tab and click on 'Create Blank Floppy' button 
  in 0.8.8 or click 'Create Standard Floppy' for use in Workbench or use 'Create 
  Custom Floppy' for some games to save files to.<br>
  For specific save game disks visit <a href="http://www.back2roots.org/Games/Savedisks/" target="_top"> 
  Back 2 Roots - Savedisks</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>12. I have all my floppy drives full how do I change disks?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Press END key and either F1, F2, F3, F4 to do a disk change.<br>
  Using SHIFT+END and F1-F4 will eject the disk.<br>
  You can also press F12 for the setup screen and select Floppy to change the 
  disk while its running.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>13. How do I save the current 'State' of a game?</strong><br>
  <br>
  On Winuae 0.8.17 or later you can now save the current state by pressing F12, 
  go to the Misc screen and click 'Save current state'<br>
  which will save the state as a .USS file. Use 'Load a save-state snapshot' to 
  load state file. You will need as much disk space as<br>
  memory allocated to the Amiga.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>14. What do I need to network my Amiga and PC?</strong><br>
  <br>
  If you do not have Crossdos or MSH installed on your Amiga, a serial network 
  is needed to transfer files between them instead of via floppy. All you need 
  is the following items:<br>
  a) Terminal software for Amiga and PC, preferably ones than can do Binary Transfers 
  using common protocols such as Kermit and X/Y/ZModem. Amiga term programs include 
  NComm, JRComm, and Term. PC term programs include Terminal and Terminus.<br>
  A commonly used program called <a href="files/twinexpress.lha">Twin Express</a> 
  can be used instead or <i>PC2Ami</i> or <a href="http://www.ntware.com/workstation/terminal.html"> 
  AmigaTrans</a> or <a href="http://cloanto.com/amiga/explorer/">Amiga Explorer</a> 
  from Cloanto.<br>
  b) A serial cable with 9pin end for PC and 25 pin end for Amiga. It has to be 
  a null-modem cable which means that lines 2 and 3 have to cross over to receive/transmit 
  between peers and line 7 for control signals.<br>
  c) Connect the computers with serial lead and load up the software on each end.<br>
  d) Start binary receive on one end using one of the protocols common to both 
  programs.<br>
  e) Start binary transmit on the other and load the file to be transmitted, it 
  should then transfer to the other end in seconds/minutes depending on size.<br>
  f) Further details of networking can be found at <a href="http://fly.to/jetjockey" target="_top">

  <br>
  <strong>15. Why should I buy Amiga Forever CD or AF Online?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Unless you have access to a real Amiga, or have bought a Kickstart and Workbench 
  disks, there is no other legal way of getting the OS for your emulation. The 
  software is the property of Amiga Inc and only they can licence it to companies. 
  Cloanto, have a licence, to distribute Amiga Emulation with Kickstart rom files 
  and Workbench images from CD or from their web site. The CD also includes some 
  popular Amiga Software, a complete Workbench hard disk setup, MPEG videos of 
  Jay Miner's speech and the Deathbed Vigil (last days of Commodore), Amiga Explorer 
  network program etc.<br>
  <br>
  For easy access you can download the online version for as little as $20, you 
  get Kickstart and Workbench 1.3 and 3.0, PPaint 7.1, an easy setup menu system, 
  Amiga Explorer and the Emulation programs themselves. These would cost a lot 
  more if bought seperately. For beginners, it is ideal to set up an Amiga on 
  your PC within minutes than having to search the web for them and fiddle with 
  setups to get it to work!<br>

  <strong>16. Can I access the Internet through Winuae?</strong><br>
  <br>
  That is possible. You can through the PC's Internet connection by enabling the 
  <strong>BSD socket library support</strong> feature on the MISC page of Winuae configuration. 
  Make sure you go on line before loading Winuae.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>17. I am new to the Amiga, I don't understand the jargon?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Like any new computer platform, I comes with its own terms, technology and jargon. 
  The Amiga has its own hardware and operating system and to use it to the full, 
  it is usually a good idea to learn some of the jargon and learn how to use AmigaOS. 
  My guides can be read on the PC using WinGuide or AmigaGuide or Multiview on 
  the Amiga. See <a href="guides.html">Guides Page</a> and <a href="misclink.html">Misc. 
  Amiga links</a><br>
  <br>
  <strong>18. I cannot install AmigaOS 3.5, it crashes during main install?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Try changing the Sound options to better level e.g. 16 bit and 44.1 Hz and change 
  the CPU settings to adjustable and to level 1. Alternatively, edit out references 
  to playing sounds (such as the clapping noise) in the Installer script (if you 
  know what you are doing).<br>
  There is no need to create an Emergency disk as this will not work under emulation 
  but booting off any Workbench ADF would be sufficient to install AmigaOS 3.5 
  or 3.9.<br>
  There is an update available for AmigaOS 3.9 called a Boing Bag and to get it 
  to install on WinUAE you need a patch available from <a href="http://www.amiga.com/3.9">Amiga 
  Inc</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>19. How can I make or see inside ADF files without using an emulator?</strong><br>
  <br>
  You need <a href="http://www.zipworld.com.au/~gharris/adfopus.html" target="_top">ADFOpus</a> 
  or <a href="http://home.worldonline.dk/viksoe/adfview.htm">ADFView</a> which 
  will allow you to create and explore and manipulate the contents of Amiga Disk 
  Format images easily. ADFOpus also features a DMS-ADF-ADZ image converter as 
  well.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>20. I am having problems running some programs or games on UAE</strong><br>
  <br>
  First make sure your UAE configuration matches the game's requirements. Very 
  old games depend on specific versions of Kickstart, processor and memory. See 
  list of Amiga specs at <a href="uae_setup.html">UAE Setup</a> to see what configurations 
  to try. If you still have problems then download <a href="http://jffabre.free.fr/amiga/patches.html">JST</a> 
  or <a href="http://www.whdload.de/">WHDLoad</a> program which can degrade the 
  Amiga to such a state that the program will run correctly.<br>
  Also, try using Fellow or WinFellow as an alternative emulator to run the game.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>21. What is the best way to transfer files between a PC and Amiga?</strong><br>
  <br>
  As well as CrossDos or MSH to use floppy or other removable media you can use 
  the internet such as FTP to a site and and download it to your Amiga or you 
  can use a simple Serial Network and use Terminal programs such as Term, NComm, 
  JRComm and HyperTerminal as use the standard file transfer protocols. Alternatively, 
  use the Amiga Explorer program supplied with Amiga Forever to do transfers. 
  If you don't have any comms software on the Amiga, try the free <a href="http://www.ntware.com/workstation/terminal.html">AmigaTrans</a> 
  program.<br>
  <br>
  If you have an Amiga Hard Disk and want to transfer its contents, try this suite 
  of programs at <a href="http://www.infinito.it/utenti/bizzetti/dftamipc/DFTAmiPC.ZIP">DFTAmiPC</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>22. I have installed Windows XP Home Edition but WinUAE now crashes?</strong><br>
  <br>
  You need to run older versions of Winuae in Compatibility Mode. Find Winuae.exe 
  and select it, press right mouse button and select <strong>Properties</strong>, select 
  <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab and change the Compatibility mode to <strong>Windows 98/Windows 
  Me</strong> and tick 'Disable Windows themes'. Winuae should now load. For Amiga 
  Forever 4 users, the setup will crash, please download latest version of WinUAE 
  (see above) and install that, alternatively get Amiga Forever 5.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>23. Where can I download a good Workbench set up from with useful programs?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Get Amiga In a Box from <a href="http://aiab.emuunlim.com/">AIAB</a> which includes 
  Scalos (Workbench replacement), MUI 3.8, Picasso96, NewIcons, VisualPrefs, MCP, 
  MUI tools and Screentab. There are addons for Music, Internet, Languages and 
  Shapeshifter.<br>
<p> 
<p><strong>24. When I run Winuae, I get an error DINPUT8.DLL not found?</strong></p>
<p>You need <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/">DirectX 8</a> or later 
  installed. Run DXDiag.exe to see what version you have installed.</p>
<p><strong>25. How do I create a bootable floppy (real or ADF)?</strong>
<p>Boot off your Workbench disk, insert a floppy disk in DF1:, open a command 
  Shell and type <strong>Install DF1:</strong> which will copy the book block on to the 
  disk. Then type <strong>MakeDir DF1:S</strong> to create the Script directory. Copy your 
  program file(s) on the disk, preferably root or use directories if you wanted 
  to. Then change directory to DF1:S and type <strong>Ed Startup-sequence</strong> and type 
  in commands to load your program, usually just the name of the Program file 
  will do. Test the disk, by inserting the disk into DF0: and Reboot the Amiga.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>26. I have a Workbench disk but no Install disk, how do I install Workbench?</strong></p>
<p>You can download UAEInstall.adf disk which has some AmigaDOS or Installer scripts 
  to install Workbench for most Workbenchs incl 1.3 to 3.1.</p>
<p><strong>27. Is there an emulator for the AmigaOne or PPC processor?</strong></p>
<p>There is no emulator for the AmigaOne at the moment. There is a PPC emulator 
  for x86 systems from <a href="http://www.pearpc.net/">PearPC</a>.<br>
