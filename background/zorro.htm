<h2><u>Zorro Bus</u></h2>
The Zorro bus is the standard for expansion cards on the bigger Amiga models from 
the Amiga 2000 up. In the A2000 it was the Zorro-II bus which was 16 bits wide. 
The Zorro-III bus was introduced with the Amiga 3000. It is 32 bits wide and was 
one of the fastest bus systems. It's also downwards compatible with the Zorro-II 
bus. One of the main features of the Zorro bus is Autoconfig.
