<p class="headline1">Zorro Bus</p>
<p class="text">The Zorro bus is the standard for expansion cards on the bigger
  Amiga models. One of the main features of the Zorro bus is <a href="autoconfig.htm">Autoconfig</a>.</p>

<p class="headline2">Zorro</p>
<p class="text">The Zorro bus was introduced with the Amiga 1000. Cards based
  on the original Zorro bus are not compatible with the later versions.</p>

<p class="headline2">Zorro-II</p>
<p class="text">The 16 bit wide Zorro-II was introduced with the A2000.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Zorro-III</p>
<p class="text"> Zorro-III had its premiere with the A3000. This 32 bits wide
  bus was one of the fastest bus systems at the time it was released. It's also
  downwards compatible with the Zorro-II bus. By multiplexing signal lines, the
  connectors between the two latest Zorro versions remained unchanged. The Amiga
  could automatically detect if a 32 bit enabled card was in a slot, and then
  use the faster Zorro-III mode.</p>
