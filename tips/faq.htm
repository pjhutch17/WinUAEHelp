<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">What is an Amiga?</p>
<p class="text">Amigas come in two variaties: the all-in-one console type with
  keyboard, a floppy drive in right hand side and ports at the back (like a large
  C64). There is the standard Desktop type like PCs. Amigas run AmigaOS with
  Workbench as the interface (similar to W95 but no Start button) with menus
  on the screen title bar and list of drive volumes down the side. Amigas use
  the Motorola 680x0 series processor, and have their own custom Chipset (Agnus|Alice,
  Paula, Denise|Lisa, Gary etc) which looks after graphics, sound, I/O and boots
  off a Kickstart ROM (like BIOS on the PC). The Amiga was THE most popular home
  computer in the late 80s and early 90s before Commodore Business Machines went
  bust in 1993. Gateway 2000/Amiga Inc now own the Amiga, from 2004 KMOS owns
  AmigaOS.</p>

<p class="headline3">Where can I get the latest UAE?</p>
<p class="text">Have a look at our collection of <a href="../links.htm#official">official
    UAE sites</a>.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Can a PC read Amiga floppy disks?</p>
<p class="text">Yes, if you have two floppy drives and the new <a href="../links.htm#tools">Disk2FDI</a> program
  which will read Amiga Disks and write it to FDI format which is<br>
  compatible with WinUAE.<br>
  For the PC to read Amiga disks directly, extra hardware will need to be purchased
  which can read (or write) Amiga disks easily. The ISA Catweasel floppy controller
  can be used on the PC to read (or write) Amiga disks. Further information is
  available from the web site at <a href="../links.htm#shops">Individual Computers</a>.<br>
  Finally, if these options are not feasible, why not buy a real Amiga second
  hand for those occasions when you want to transfer files and you'll have access
  to a real KS and WB for use on your main machine.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">What are ADFs, ADZ, LHA, LZX, DMS, ZIP and Z files?</p>
<p class="text">An ADF is an image of an Amiga disk, so that the long filenames,
  comments, and flags are kept. The ADFs have to be copied to PC formatted disks
  to be read on the Amiga. ADZ files are GZIP'd ADF files. You need GZIP.EXE
  to access the original ADF files. Keeping them GZIP'd will save space and WinUAE
  can extract them automatically.<br>
  LHA is the common file archive format on the Amiga, Aminet uses it a lot as
  well as DMS (Disk Masher) which is a disk archive format. You can use DMS,
  xDMS or ADFOpus to extract or convert DMS archives to ADF. You need LHA and
  LZX programs to archive or unarchive files. For example, to unarchive a lha
  file, type <em>LHA X GAME.LHA</em> to extract the files to the current directory.
  To make an archive, type <em>LHA A GAME.LHA GameDir/#?</em> which will add
  all files in GameDir to GAME.LHA. To list files, type <em>LHA L GAME.LHA</em>.<br>
  If using LHA on the PC with Amiga lha files, use the <strong>/ax</strong> options
  to allow the files to be extracted properly. LZX is a newer faster and more
  compact archiver than LHA and requires the LZX program to extract them. All
  these unarchivers are available from Aminet. Try the W95 UnLZX program to extract
  LZX files on your PC.<br>
  Amigas can also handle the common ZIP format using the ZIP and UNZIP commands
  (equivalent to PKZIP and PKUNZIP on the PC). The Amiga version of the unix
  GZIP format can handle .Z and .ADZ files.<br>
  You can download all the Amiga (de)archivers from here: Amiga Archivers for
  use within WinUAE or try X-Arc from <a href="../links.htm#original">Aminet</a> for
  use in Workbench.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Can I emulate a Hard Disk on the Emulator?</p>
<p class="text">Yes, that is possible. You can either specify a directory on
  the PC's hard disk e.g. C:\UAE\AmigaHD or you can specify a hard file. The <br>
  advantage of a directory is that you can copy files directly from the PC site
  into the directory for immediate access by the Emulator. For hard <br>
  files you can use the Amiga's long filenames, file comments and protection
  flags. For a hard disk to be bootable, make sure you copy the whole <br>
  Workbench disk including hidden directories. Some programs work better with
  Hard Files than directories.<br>
  For more information see <a href="../gui/hard-drives.htm">Hard disk setup</a>.<br>
  WinUAE 0.8.22 or later can read Amiga Formatted hard disks directly via the
  Hard Drives tab on WinUAE. Click on Add Harddrive and it <br>
  will list any connected Amiga harddrives or any empty harddrive space to add
  to WinUAE. On older emulators, you could only access hard <br>
  disks via the AFFS file system on Linux or a third party program such as ADFOpus.<br>
  If using Workbench 1.3, it is now possible to use HardFiles if you copy the
  FastFileSystem file to the WinUAE roms directory first (0.8.22r1 or later).<br>
  The HDF may not be recognised on bootup, in which case, boot off a WB2 or later
  disk to format it, then WB1.3 can then see it.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Can I access Amiga CDs via the Emulator?</p>
<p class="text">Yes, Amiga CDs use the same filesystem for CDs as the PC i.e.
  ISO9660 except that it uses the Rock Ridge extension for long filenames, PCS
  use<br>
  a filesystem called Joliet for long filenames. CacheCDFS can read all these
  formats. </p>
<p class="text">There are two ways to access Amiga CD disks: insert the CD into
  your CD drive, on the Hard Drive screen of WinUAE, click 'Add Directory' <br>
  and then enter the volume name of the CD and the drive letter of the CD-ROM
  drive e.g. D: (without the slash). Use the Diskchange &lt;device&gt; <br>
  command in a Shell if you change CDs (type Info for list of devices).</p>
<p class="text">With WinUAE 0.8.21 or later you can install the CacheCDFS CDROM
  drivers from either AmigaOS3.9 CD or a third party driver such as<br>
  AmiCDFS. You need to enable uaescsi.device on the Misc tab before starting
  WinUAE and enable Logging to determine the Unit<br>
  numbers (see WinUAElog.txt file) for your CDROM drive. When you install the
  drive make sure the device is uaescsi.device and the unit numbers <br>
  match the unit numbers in the log file.</p>
<p class="text">Example if you have only an IDE controller:</p>
<p class="text"> 0=Primary Master<br>
  1=Secondary Master</p>
<p class="text">On Win9x/ME (with Adaptec ASPI which is installed by almost all
  CD burning software solutions) you can not use CD burning programs like MakeCD.
  When you use WinXP, it is best to switch off &quot;Use ASPI Scsi Layer&quot; the <a href="../gui/misc.htm">Misc
  settings</a> page. Only activate it if you notice problems without it.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">What limitations can I expect from using WinUAE?</p>
<p class="text">An emulator can not fully emulate everything on the Amiga as
  it has to emulate the CPU and the Custom Chipset and all other special hardware.
  The latest versions of WinUAE will try to use buffers for sound to improve
  output and JIT for extra CPU speed, chipset graphics is improving but 256 colours
  can be very slow due to the Amiga's bitmap system of using multiple layers.
  Using Picasso96 emulation can improve graphics a lot, use that wherever possible.<br>
  Emulators are improved all the time, so keep an eye out for new versions. Sound
  emulation can depend on your processor as well, turning it off will improve
  emulation speed though.<br>
  It can not use the MMU on higher 680x0 processors. This means that programs
  that require Memory Management such as Linux or Virtual Memory will not work
  in WinUAE.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">How do I create a blank disk for saving files or games?</p>
<p class="text">For WinUAE, goto <strong>Floppies</strong> tab and click on 'Create
  Blank Floppy' button in 0.8.8 or click 'Create Standard Floppy' for use in
  Workbench or use 'Create Custom Floppy' for some games to save files to.<br>
  For specific save game disks visit <a href="../links.htm#help">Back2Roots</a>.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I have all my floppy drives full, how do I change disks?</p>
<p class="text">Press END key and either F1, F2, F3, F4 to do a disk change.<br>
  Using SHIFT+END and F1-F4 will eject the disk.<br>
  You can also press F12 for the setup screen and select Floppy to change the
  disk while its running.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3"> How do I save the current &quot;State&quot; of a game?</p>
<p class="text">On WinUAE 0.8.17 or later you can now save the current state
  by pressing F12, go to the Misc screen and click 'Save current state'<br>
  which will save the state as a .USS file. Use 'Load a save-state snapshot'
  to load state file. You will need as much disk space as<br>
  memory allocated to the Amiga.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Why should I buy Amiga Forever CD or AF Online?</p>
<p class="text">Unless you have access to a real Amiga, or have bought a Kickstart
  and Workbench disks, there is no other legal way of getting the OS for your
  emulation. The software is the property of Amiga Inc and only they can licence
  it to companies. Cloanto, have a licence, to distribute Amiga Emulation with
  Kickstart ROM files and Workbench images from CD or from their web site. The
  CD also includes some popular Amiga Software, a complete Workbench hard disk
  setup, MPEG videos of Jay Miner's speech and the Deathbed Vigil (last days
  of Commodore), Amiga Explorer network program etc.You can also boot from the
  CD direct into the Emulator without the need of a host OS using KX Light.<br>
  <br>
  For easy access you can download the online version for as little as $20, you
  get Kickstart and Workbench 1.3 and 3.0, PPaint 7.1, an easy setup menu system,
  Amiga Explorer and the Emulation programs themselves. These would cost a lot
  more if bought seperately. For beginners, it is ideal to set up an Amiga on
  your PC within minutes than having to search the web for them and fiddle with
  setups to get it to work!<br>

  Forever</a>.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Can I access the Internet through WinUAE?</p>
<p class="text">That is possible. You can through the PC's Internet connection
  by enabling the <strong>BSD socket library support</strong> feature on the
  MISC page of WinUAE configuration. Make sure you go on line before loading
  WinUAE.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I cannot install AmigaOS 3.5, it crashes during main install?</p>
<p class="text">Try changing the Sound options to better level e.g. 16 bit and
  44.1 Hz and change the CPU settings to adjustable and to level 1. Alternatively,
  edit out references to playing sounds (such as the clapping noise) in the Installer
  script (if you know what you are doing).<br>
  There is no need to create an Emergency disk as this will not work under emulation
  but booting off any Workbench ADF would be sufficient to install AmigaOS 3.5
  or 3.9.<br>
  There is an update available for AmigaOS 3.9 called a Boing Bag and to get
  it to install on WinUAE you need a patch available from <a href="../links.htm#original">Amiga,
  Inc</a>.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">How can I make or see inside ADF files without using an
  emulator?</p>
<p class="text">You need ADFOpus or ADFView which will allow you to create and
  explore and manipulate the contents of Amiga Disk Format images easily. ADFOpus
  also features a DMS-ADF-ADZ image converter as well. Both tools can be found
  in our <a href="../links.htm#tools">links section</a>.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I am having problems running some programs or games using
  WinUAE</p>
<p class="text">First make sure your UAE configuration matches the game's requirements.
  Very old games depend on specific versions of Kickstart, processor and memory.
  See list of Amiga specs to see what configurations to try. If you still have
  problems then download a patch from the <a href="../links.htm#help">Patch &amp; HD
  Installers Page</a> or <a href="../links.htm#tools">WHDLoad</a>, which can
  degrade the Amiga to such a state that the program will run correctly. You
  will probably need to get the latest AmigaOS Installer from <a href="../links.htm#original">Aminet</a> to
  install these tools.<br>
  Also, try using Fellow or <a href="../links.htm#emulators">WinFellow</a> as
  an alternative emulator to run the game.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I have installed Windows XP Home Edition but WinUAE now
  crashes?</p>
<p class="text">You need to run older versions of WinUAE in Compatibility Mode.
  Find WinUAE.exe and select it, press right mouse button and select <strong>Properties</strong>,
  select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab and change the Compatibility mode
  to <strong>Windows 98/Windows Me</strong> and tick 'Disable Windows themes'.
  WinUAE should now load. For Amiga Forever 4 users, the setup will crash, please
  download latest version of WinUAE (see above) and install that, alternatively
  get Amiga Forever 5.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Where can I download a good Workbench set up from with useful
  programs?</p>
<p class="text">Get Amiga In a Box from <a href="../links.htm#tools">AIAB</a> which
  includes Scalos (Workbench replacement), MUI 3.8, Picasso96, NewIcons, VisualPrefs,
  MCP, MUI tools and Screentab. There are addons for Music, Internet, Languages
  and Shapeshifter.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">When I run WinUAE, I get an error DINPUT8.DLL not found?</p>
<p class="text">You need <a href="../links.htm#essential">DirectX 8</a> or later
  installed. Run DXDiag.exe to see what version you have installed.</p>

<p class="headline3">How do I create a bootable floppy (real or ADF)?</p>
<p class="text">Boot off your Workbench disk, insert a floppy disk in DF1:, open
  a command Shell and type <strong>Install DF1:</strong> which will copy the
  book block on to the disk. Then type <strong>MakeDir DF1:S</strong> to create
  the Script directory. Copy your program file(s) on the disk, preferably root
  or use directories if you wanted to. Then change directory to DF1:S and type <strong>Ed
  Startup-sequence</strong> and type in commands to load your program, usually
  just the name of the Program file will do. Test the disk, by inserting the
  disk into DF0: and Reboot the Amiga.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I have a Workbench disk but no Install disk, how do I install
  Workbench?</p>
<p class="text">You can download UAEInstall.adf disk which has some AmigaDOS
  or Installer scripts to install Workbench for most Workbenchs incl 1.3 to 3.1.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Is there an emulator for the AmigaOne or PPC processor?</p>
<p class="text">There is a Classic Amiga emulator for the AmigaOne that comes
  with AmigaOS 4. There is a PPC emulator for x86 systems from <a href="../links.htm#emulators">PearPC</a>.</p>
