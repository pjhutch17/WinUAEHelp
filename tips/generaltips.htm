FOR NON GAMERS<br>
</p>
<p class="headline2">Some
tips to get happier with WINUAE</p>
<p class="headline3">Set
the CPU Idle slider to best values to save Money.</p>
<p class="text">Modern
CPU´s save much power when they have nothing to do,for example you
write a text or&nbsp; work with your workbench hear MP3 music.A
AMD64 use in idle Mode 10 Watt.In full load Mode he use 83 Watt.A
P4&nbsp; Prescot with E0 Stepping have too the ability to save much
power.A Athlon XP must disconnect the bus.Most BIOS have this not
activate,because&nbsp; old CPU´s have Bugs.But you can activate it
and try it out,if system work stable<br>
</p>
<p class="text">So
use CPU idle save you money,give you lower temperature and if your fans
are temperature controlled lower noise.<br>
</p>
<p class="text">In
the Tab CPU you can choose the optimal value for Power save.The CPU
must be set to Fastest possible in A500 Mode winuae save always power<br>
</p>
<p class="text">You must
set the slider so far right,that the windows Task manager show for CPU
load
ca 10-15%.If you set it more right,you save more CPU load,but the clock
run slower and winuae is slower then.But if you are on the road with a
notebook it is maybe a good choose to give a little speed for longer
accu life.The incorrect clock you can avoid with timehack program<br>
</p>
<p class="headline3">If
you feel winuae is slow<br>
</p>
<p class="text">Make
sure you have the rtg.library from winuae Install Amigaprograms
folder <br>
copy in libs:picasso96. <br>
Start the program p96_uae_tweak from&nbsp; <a href="amigaprogs.htm">amiga
prog</a> Folder
If you notice large slowdown
when 16bit ahi is activate:<br>
Start
the ahitweak&nbsp; from&nbsp; <a href="amigaprogs.htm">amiga
prog</a> Folder.
increase the Pollrate (the rate winuae check for soundbuffer
free).Default is 40,but
can be set in most cases to 60. Set
paula buffer in winuae prefs to 4 or 5.If you use programs that need no
paula set in winuae prefs disabled but emulate to Paula.To hear system
sounds you can use ahisyssound found in Aminet .</p>
<p class="text">Use
hardfiles for more speed and only directory
filesystem for stuff that you can share with windows (images music
etc...)<br>
<span ="">
<p class="headline3">Printing
with Winuae</p>
<p class="text">
There are currently 2 ways to print with winuae.</p>
<p class="text">For
the same way as
classic amiga&nbsp; choose in winuae tab game&amp;io
Ports&nbsp; Paralell Port&nbsp; your Printer .Make sure
Postscript&nbsp; detection and Post Script Printer Emulation are
not checked.If you use winxp win2k set the autoflush timeout to 2.Now
you can save your config and can start winuae and make the rest on
amigaside.If you use turboprint dont use the turboprint spooler and
choose parallel Port or turbopar for the print device.If you print
something you should see then in windows printer spooler&nbsp; a
entry.Then you can be sure all work ok</p>
<p class="text">If
you have no printer that is support from&nbsp;
amigaside you can choose the postscript output.For this you need
install ghostscript for windows.I use gsv46w32.exe sucsessfully.On
winuae start game&amp;io Ports tab you now need to choose the
printer and check
on&nbsp; Postscript&nbsp; detection and Post Script Printer
Emulation.Note: You cant change that on the fly (when press F12).<br>
Boot your amigainstall.I found out,that turboprint dont work (test on
classic with several people and winuae ).It print only a empty page
with
below text Page 1. <br>
So remove turbostart if you have and choose the workbench postscript
Printer.Note the OS3.5 and
OS3.9 driver crash when you use greyscale or black and white.Choose
Color.Set it on all printer prefs pages.The real output format you
choose with the windows printer prefs.<br>
Note: Most time it is enough to use on the workbench printer 300
dpi.Higher res need only lots of memory and cost lots of time.<br>
The printer&nbsp; must dither colors so it is important here to
choose on windows side 600 or 1200 dpi .<br>
If you really want greyscale and Black&amp;white from amigaside use
the driver from OS3.1.This work.The OS3.5 and OS3.9 driver seem have a
compiler Bug ,i&nbsp; get it also not work on my Real Classic<br>
</p>
<p class="headline3">The
uae_german keymap does not support µ or € Symbols</p>
<p class="text">Recommend
is the use of german_keymap_new.zip and set input other then
compatibility Mode.This map is perfect compatible.For Euro you need of
course a character set that support Euro Symbol, but work not in
compatibility mode.See also the readme of it. Works only on 0.9.90 and
above.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Using
a Mousewheel</p>
<p class="text">This
work same as real amiga.Use the tool Freewheel from AmiNet.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">WinUAE
does not accept my hardfiles or show only CLI with my always used config</p>
<p class="text">This
happen if another WinUAE run. It is not allow to use the hardfile with
another WinUAE session. In very rare situation a very bad Amiga program
crash can happen that WinUAE does not release the hardfile.So you cant
load it in when you quit and start WinUAE. Reboot in this case Windows.
Now all should work. If WinUAE take long to boot you can switch on
drive leds in GUI. If the Harddrive LED is on you know the hardfile is
validate so you must wait.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Install
OS3.9 when you have a running aiab (fastest way to get OS3.9 work)</p>
<p class="text">If
you dont have <a href="../links.htm">AIAB</a>
it is recommended to install it, it is much easier than installing from
real Amiga emergency floppy.</p>
<ol>
  <li class="text">Boot
from AIAB</li>
  <li class="text">Insert
the OS3.9 CD</li>
  <li class="text">Start
the OS3.9 Installer and choose "Make emergency floppy"<br>
The installer will create an emergency floppy with correct CD rom
support and P96 support with correct rtg.library</li>
  <li class="text">Boot
from the emergency floppy</li>
  <li class="text">You
are ready to install OS3.9</li>
</ol>
<p class="text"><strong>Hint:</strong>
If you get CD read errors you need reduce the max transfer rate in your
CD-ROM driver settings. </p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">After
resuming from hybernate state, the Amiga Clock shows the wrong time</p>
<p class="text">Use
the <a href="amigaprogs.htm">amiga
program</a> timehack. This is maybe
also useful if you throttled CPU idle too much because time can then
run 3-10% slower.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">How
can i make custom screenresolutions for WinUAE</p>
<p class="text">Powerstrip
works OK now since Version 3.3 and nVidia drivers version 40 or later,
so please make sure you are using the latest version of Powerstrip and
nVidia drivers.</p>
<p class="text">Create
the modes:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Change
into the menu displayprofile -&gt; configure</li>
  <li class="text">Click
advanced timing options -&gt; custom resolutions -&gt; user
defined</li>
  <li class="text">Set
desired values and reboot windows if necessary</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">It
is also possible to create interlaced doublescan resolutions in this
menu.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">How
can i install Os3.5 and 3.9 from emergency Floppy disk</p>
<p class="text">It
is only allowed to use OS3.5 or 3.9 on 1 Computer at the same time.
Read the H&amp;P license carefully. Maybe H&amp;P placed a note
in the license of newer OS3.9 distributions that restricts its use to
AmigaHardware.</p>
<p class="text">Here
we go:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="text">Insert
the emergency floppy in your old Amiga</li>
  <li class="text">Use <a href="../started/transdisk.htm">Transdisk</a>
to create an ADF and <a href="../started/pcamitrans.htm">transfer</a>
it to your PC</li>
  <li class="text">Boot
your emulated Amiga with WinUAE and "insert" the ADF in a floppy drive </li>
  <li class="text">Open
the file devs/dosdrivers/emergency_CD on the disk with a texteditor</li>
  <li class="text">Change
the line device ="xxxxxx to device ="uaescsi.device"</li>
  <li class="text">Change
UnitNum if needed</li>
  <li class="text">Change
the text MaxTransfer = xxxxxxx to MaxTransfer =0xffff<br>
If you get read/write errors from CD use a value of 0x1fff instead</li>
  <li class="text">Save
the changed file to disk</li>
  <li class="text">Boot
from the emergency disk and make sure the OS3.5/3.9 CD is inserted</li>
</ol>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Using
a real Amiga formatTeD Harddrive in WinUAE</p>
<p class="text">This
can be done in the <a href="../gui/hard-drives.htm">harddrive
page</a> in the GUI. If there is no
drive listed, it is possible that this drive has no Amiga/Amithlon
Partition. Note that this feature is not available in Windows 9x/ME
environments.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I
have several damaged Amigas can i use the kickstart from them</p>
<p class="text">Follow
the instructions on the <a href="../started/transrom.htm">Transrom</a>
page.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Using
other filesystems on Hardfiles (SFS tested)</p>
<p class="text">Create
a Hardfile. For use with HDToolbox you must set the Sector Surface and
Reserved numbers to 0. The volume name should show N/A. Make a
hdtoolsbox Icon with device=uaehf.device. Now do all steps like with a
real Amiga with HDToolsBox..</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">
The mouse pointer freezes sometimes and I have to reboot</p>
<p class="text">Make
sure you have the serial port enabled and correctly configured. Also,
make sure the "Shared" checkbox is checked to loose no speed.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Differences
of CD drivers </p>
<p class="text">AsimCDFS:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Fails
if you mount more than 1 CD drive (all devices show the same CD content)</li>
  <li class="text">Seems
to be a bug in AsimCDFS, because it happens on real Amigas as well</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">cacheCDFS:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Set
the MaxTransfer size to 0x10000 (65 kb) in the mountfile</li>
  <li class="text">This
make cacheCDFS working and not display the read/write error Requesters</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Harddrive
performance</p>
<p> <span class="text">Use
hardfiles as your main drive to avoid trouble, especially when using
Windows 9x/ME for numerous reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Amiga
harddrives easily contain several 1000 files. This is too much for
Windows 9x/ME because Windows needs to cache the directories, since
FAT32 is slow. For example, if you try to delete the Windows directory
from DOS without smartdrive, you will find out that this takes several
hours.</li>
  <li class="text">The
maximum number of files is limitet on FAT32.</li>
  <li class="text">Keep
every hardfile smaller than 500 MB, because booting from a 1GB hardfile
takes longer.</li>
  <li class="text">Also
a backup from hardfiles is fast. 270MB takes 1 min with 1 Drive, 0.5
Min with two drives.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">It
is recommended to install the AmigaOS and programs on a hardfile, so
the access and backup can be done quickly. To store pictures and other
data, you may use a Windows directory for easier data exchange with the
PC.<br>
Transferring data from/to a hardfile can done by simply copying it, so
you don't have to install all your Amiga stuff again.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">
Get UAE working in every dir/drive without changing configs</p>
<p class="text">Make
use of relative pathes to realize this.</p>
<p class="text">Example:<br>
WinUAE is in C:\Amiga\WinUAE, and Kickstart ROMs are in
C:\Amiga\Kickstart.<br>
For the kickstart path, enter ..\Kickstart.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">
UAE doesn't boot due to Picasso96 failure (Picasso96 is extremely slow)</p>
<p class="text">Start
UAE and immediately press both Mousebuttons when the main window is
shown. In the Amiga Early Startup select "Boot without
Startup-Sequence". Now remove or move the uaegfx file in devs:monitors.
Start UAE, now the Workbench shows up. Just select a AmigaMode Save and
copy uaegfx to devs/monitors again. If this should fail, reinstall
Picasso96.</p>
<p class="text">
Don't forget to copy the rtg.library file, which can be found in the
AmigaPrograms directory, to libs:picasso96.This&nbsp; is important
for full speed of winuae.<br>
</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">A
chipset Mode that UAE does not display makes UAE fail</p>
<p> <span class="text">OS 3.1:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Boot
without aStartup-Sequence (from Amiga Early Startup menu), type loadwb
in the CLI, and press "Cancel" on the "ENV:" warnings</li>
  <li class="text">Start
the screenmode selector</li>
  <li class="text">Select
a standard PAL mode. Save it, reboot and select your preferred mode</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">
OS 3.5/3.9:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Copy
an old Screenmode prefs program from 3.1 to your HD, because the new
one will not work this way.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">UAE
large boottime (memory usage)</p>
<p class="text">As
a rule of thumb, WinUAE needs 60+Z3+Chip+Fast+Picasso96 MB of system
memory.<br>
Since WinUAE 0.8.17r1, memory is allocated dynamically. This means you
can select 512MB Z3 Mem and find no difference in boot time, but if you
work with UAE for a longer time, it may get very slow. So it is better
that you calculate your RAM needs with the above formula and make sure
that it is lower than the pysical limit. Windows has to store the data
on the harddisk if it runs out of RAM, which is a gigantic performance
hit.<br>
Also try to activate "Suspend to Disk" mode. UAE and Windows will be
ready to use within 30 seconds.Dont forget to use the program&nbsp;
timehack to set the amigaclock correct<br>
</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">UAE
shows a green screen on boot</p>
<p class="text">Go
to the <a href="../gui/cpu.htm">CPU

Mode</span> or disable JIT
completely.</p>

<p class="headline3">Tips
for Tuning or random crashes<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">If
you have an old HD (500MB), install a pure Windows for testing
purposes. Does the program work ?</li>
  <li class="text">Overclock
your PC by 10% by using the bus clock. If it works correctly your PC
seems to be stable. If it works for 4 minutes, it seems to be stable,
too. If it doesn't work, try downclock it. Less crashes?</li>
  <li class="text">A
problem on non UDMA HD is that PIO4 or SCSI have no transfer error
detection. So try to let your PC run on PIO3 (DMA still works) a month
or so. The speed loss is not measurable in daily use, because Windows
normally transfers small blocks. Less crashes?</li>
  <li class="text">You
can install Sysmon by using the Windows installer. With this tooly
you can see how many kB/sec are transferred and how much memory a
program uses. So you see if the the program is slow is related to the
memory. Normally the allocated memory should not exceed your physical
memory by more than 30 MB. If so, you can increase speed by using more
memory.</li>
  <li class="text">I
found out that, large drives are better than drives with high RPM. A
9 GB 10000 RPM SCSI drive is slower than a 40GB 7200 RPM IDE drive, if
you use the same partition size.</li>
</ul>
