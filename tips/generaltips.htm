<p class="headline2">Some tips to get happier with WinUAE</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">The uae_german keymap does not support &micro; or &euro; Symbols</p>
<p class="text">Recommend is the use of german_keymap_new.zip and set input other
  then compatibility Mode.This map is perfect compatible.For Euro you need of
  course a character set that support Euro Symbol, but work not in compatibility
  mode.See also the readme of it. Works only on 0.9.90 and above.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Using a Mousewheel</p>
<p class="text">This work same as real amiga.Use the tool Freewheel from AmiNet.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">WinUAE does not accept my hardfiles or show only CLI with
  my always used config</p>
<p class="text">This happen if another WinUAE run. It is not allow to use the
  hardfile with another WinUAE session. In very rare situation a very bad Amiga
  program crash can happen that WinUAE does not release the hardfile.So you cant
  load it in when you quit and start WinUAE. Reboot in this case Windows. Now
  all should work. If WinUAE take long to boot you can switch on drive leds in
  GUI. If the Harddrive LED is on you know the hardfile is validate so you must
  wait.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Install OS3.9 when you have a running aiab (fastest way
  to get OS3.9 work)</p>
<p class="text">If you dont have <a href="../links.htm">AIAB</a> it is recommended
  to install it, it is much easier than installing from real Amiga emergency
  floppy.</p>
<ol>
  <li class="text">Boot from AIAB</li>
  <li class="text"> Insert the OS3.9 CD</li>
  <li class="text"> Start the OS3.9 Installer and choose &quot;Make emergency
    floppy&quot;<br>
    The installer will create an emergency floppy with correct CD rom support
    and P96 support with correct rtg.library</li>
  <li class="text">Boot from the emergency floppy</li>
  <li class="text">You are ready to install OS3.9</li>
</ol>
<p class="text"><strong>Hint:</strong> If you get CD read errors you need reduce
  the max transfer rate in your CD-ROM driver settings. </p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">After resuming from hybernate state, the Amiga Clock shows
  the wrong time</p>
<p class="text">Use the <a href="amigaprogs.htm">amiga program</a> timehack.
  This is maybe also useful if you throttled CPU idle too much because time can
  then run 3-10% slower.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">How can i make custom screenresolutions for WinUAE</p>
<p class="text">Powerstrip works OK now since Version 3.3 and nVidia drivers
  version 40 or later, so please make sure you are using the latest version of
  Powerstrip and nVidia drivers.</p>
<p class="text">Create the modes:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text"> Change into the menu displayprofile -&gt; configure</li>
  <li class="text">Click advanced timing options -&gt; custom resolutions -&gt; user
    defined</li>
  <li class="text">Set desired values and reboot windows if necessary</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">It is also possible to create interlaced doublescan resolutions
  in this menu.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">How can i install Os3.5 and 3.9 from emergency Floppy disk</p>
<p class="text">It is only allowed to use OS3.5 or 3.9 on 1 Computer at the same
  time. Read the H&amp;P license carefully. Maybe H&amp;P placed a note in the
  license of newer OS3.9 distributions that restricts its use to AmigaHardware.</p>
<p class="text">Here we go:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="text">Insert the emergency floppy in your old Amiga</li>
  <li class="text">Use <a href="../started/transdisk.htm">Transdisk</a> to create
    an ADF and <a href="../started/pcamitrans.htm">transfer</a> it to your PC</li>
  <li class="text">Boot your emulated Amiga with WinUAE and &quot;insert&quot; the
    ADF in a floppy drive </li>
  <li class="text">Open the file devs/dosdrivers/emergency_CD on the disk with
    a texteditor</li>
  <li class="text">Change the line device =&quot;xxxxxx to device =&quot;uaescsi.device&quot;</li>
  <li class="text">Change UnitNum if needed</li>
  <li class="text">Change the text MaxTransfer = xxxxxxx to MaxTransfer =0xffff<br>
    If you get read/write errors from CD use a value of 0x1fff instead</li>
  <li class="text">Save the changed file to disk</li>
  <li class="text">Boot from the emergency disk and make sure the OS3.5/3.9 CD
    is inserted</li>
</ol>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Using a real Amiga formatTeD Harddrive in WinUAE</p>
<p class="text">This can be done in the <a href="../gui/hard-drives.htm">harddrive
    page</a> in the GUI. If there is no drive listed, it is possible that this
    drive has no Amiga/Amithlon Partition. Note that this feature is not available
    in Windows 9x/ME environments.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I have several damaged Amigas can i use the kickstart from
  them</p>
<p class="text">Follow the instructions on the <a href="../started/transrom.htm">Transrom</a> page.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Using other filesystems on Hardfiles (SFS tested)</p>
<p class="text">Create a Hardfile. For use with HDToolbox you must set the Sector
  Surface and Reserved numbers to 0. The volume name should show N/A. Make a
  hdtoolsbox Icon with device=uaehf.device. Now do all steps like with a real
  Amiga with HDToolsBox..</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3"> The mouse pointer freezes sometimes and I have to reboot</p>
<p class="text">Make sure you have the serial port enabled and correctly configured.
  Also, make sure the &quot;Shared&quot; checkbox is checked to loose no speed.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Differences of CD drivers </p>
<p class="text">AsimCDFS:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Fails if you mount more than 1 CD driv (all devices show the
    same CD content)</li>
  <li class="text">Seems to be a bug in AsimCDFS, because it happens on real
    Amigas as well</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">cacheCDFS:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Set the MaxTransfer size to 0x10000 (65 kb) in the mountfile</li>
  <li class="text">This make cacheCDFS working and not display the read/write
    error Requesters</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Harddrive performance</p>
<p> <span class="text">Use hardfiles as your main drive to avoid trouble, especially
    when using Windows 9x/ME for numerous reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Amiga harddrives easily contain several 1000 files. This is
    too much for Windows 9x/ME because Windows needs to cache the directories,
    since FAT32 is slow. For example, if you try to delete the Windows directory
    from DOS without smartdrive, you will find out that this takes several hours.</li>
  <li class="text">The maximum number of files is limitet on FAT32.</li>
  <li class="text">Keep every hardfile smaller than 500 MB, because booting from
    a 1GB hardfile takes longer.</li>
  <li class="text">Also a backup from hardfiles is fast. 270MB takes 1 min with
    1 Drive, 0.5 Min with two drives.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">It is recommended to install the AmigaOS and programs on a hardfile,
  so the access and backup can be done quickly. To store pictures and other data,
  you may use a Windows directory for easier data exchange with the PC.<br>
  Transferring data from/to a hardfile can done by simply copying it, so you
  don't have to install all your Amiga stuff again.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3"> Get UAE working in every dir/drive without changing configs</p>
<p class="text">Make use of relative pathes to realize this.</p>
<p class="text">Example:<br>
  WinUAE is in C:\Amiga\WinUAE, and Kickstart ROMs are in C:\Amiga\Kickstart.<br>
  For the kickstart path, enter ..\Kickstart.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3"> UAE doesn't boot due to Picasso96 failure (Picasso96 is
  extremely slow)</p>
<p class="text">Start UAE and immediately press both Mousebuttons when the main
  window is shown. In the Amiga Early Startup select &quot;Boot without Startup-Sequence&quot;.
  Now remove or move the uaegfx file in devs:monitors. Start UAE, now the Workbench
  shows up. Just select a AmigaMode Save and copy uaegfx to devs/monitors again.
  If this should fail, reinstall Picasso96.</p>
<p class="text"> Don't forget to copy the rtg.library file, which can be found
  in the AmigaPrograms directory, to libs:picasso96. This will remove mouse trails
  after a Picasso96 installation.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">A chipset Mode that UAE does not display makes UAE fail</p>
<p> <span class="text">OS 3.1:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Boot without aStartup-Sequence (from Amiga Early Startup menu),
    type loadwb in the CLI, and press &quot;Cancel&quot; on the &quot;ENV:&quot; warnings</li>
  <li class="text">Start the screenmode selector</li>
  <li class="text">Select a standard PAL mode. Save it, reboot and select your
    preferred mode</li>
</ul>
<p class="text"> OS 3.5/3.9:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Copy an old Screenmode prefs program from 3.1 to your HD,
    because the new one will not work this way.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">UAE large boottime (memory usage)</p>
<p class="text">As a rule of thumb, WinUAE needs 60+Z3+Chip+Fast+Picasso96 MB
  of system memory.<br>
  Since WinUAE 0.8.17r1, memory is allocated dynamically. This means you can
  select 512MB Z3 Mem and find no difference in boot time, but if you work with
  UAE for a longer time, it may get very slow. So it is better that you calculate
  your RAM needs with the above formula and make sure that it is lower than the
  pysical limit. Windows has to store the data on the harddisk if it runs out
  of RAM, which is a gigantic performance hit.<br>
  Also try to activate &quot;Suspend to Disk&quot; mode. UAE and Windows will
  be ready to use within 30 seconds.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">UAE shows a green screen on boot</p>
<p class="text">Go to the <a href="../gui/cpu.htm">CPU page</a> and select <span class="textmenu">JIT
    -&gt; Force Settings</span> and <span class="textmenu">Indirect Mode</span> or
    disable JIT completely.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">I get no picasso screens larger than 1024x768 in 32bit</p>
<p class="text"> Load <a href="amigaprogs.htm">picasso96fix</a> in the startup-sequence
  (before LoadWB).</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">The folder &quot;displaydrivers&quot;</p>
<p class="text">These are the picasso96 uae drivers. Just ignore the drawer.
  The latest Picasso96 installer has correctly working display drivers included.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline3">Tips for Tuning</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">If you have an old HD (500MB), install a pure Windows for
    testing purposes. Does the program work ?</li>
  <li class="text">Overclock your PC by 10% by using the bus clock. If it works
    correctly your PC seems to be stable. If it works for 4 minutes, it seems
    to be stable, too. If it doesn't work, try downclock it. Less crashes?</li>
  <li class="text">A problem on non UDMA HD is that PIO4 or SCSI have no transfer
    error detection. So try to let your PC run on PIO3 (DMA still works) a month
    or so. The speed loss is not measurable in daily use, because Windows normally
    transfers small blocks. Less crashes?</li>
  <li class="text"> You can install Sysmon by using the Windows installer. With
    this tooly you can see how many kB/sec are transferred and how much memory
    a program uses. So you see if the the program is slow is related to the memory.
    Normally the allocated memory should not exceed your physical memory by more
    than 30 MB. If so, you can increase speed by using more memory.</li>
  <li class="text"> I found out that, large drives are better than drives with
    high RPM. A 9 GB 10000 RPM SCSI drive is slower than a 40GB 7200 RPM IDE
    drive, if you use the same partition size.</li>
</ul>
