<p class="headline1">Amiga Programs</p>
<p class="text">Along with the WinUAE emulator program, some programs are supplied
  in the 'Amiga Programs' folder in the C:\Program Files\WinUAE folder. Here
  is an explanation of what these files are for and where to copy them to:</p>
<p class="headline2">MouseHack</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk
  or hard disk. This program will hack your mouse connected to your PC to work
  with WinUAE. In most cases it may not be needed. You can auto run it by adding
  a line to the s:user-startup file on your Workbench disk.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">Picasso96fix</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk
  or hard disk. This program will fix Picasso 96 RTG screens greater than 1024
  pixels when using your PC's graphics card with the uaegfx driver in WinUAE.
  Load it before LoadWB in the startup-sequence. The <strong>Picasso96fix.bb</strong> file
  is the source code to this program written in Blitz Basic.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">rtg.library</p>
<p class="text">Re-targetable Graphics Library. Copy this library file to your
  libs:picasso96. This library will increase the speed of WinUAE a lot.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">timehack</p>
<p class="text">This tool synchronizes the Amiga time with the current Windows
  time every second. You need this when you use the hibernation feature of your
  PC and resume to get exact time. If you need exact time (for compiler make)
  it is also recommended to use this because UAE cycletiming differs of about
  1-2 seconds per hour.</p>
<p class="text">Copy it to the Amiga system directory c. Start it in your Userstartup
  with the command <span class="textmenu">run &gt;nil: timehack</span>.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">transdisk</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk
  or hard disk. This can Transfer Disk images to or from floppy disk to an image
  or vice versa in ADF (Amiga Disk Format). Type <em>transdisk ?</em> for more
  options. See <a href="../started/transdisk.htm">trandisk</a> page for more
  details on this program.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">transrom</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk
  or hard disk. This can Transfer the Kickstart ROM image from a real Amiga to
  an image file to use with your Amiga Emulator. It will produce either a 256K
  or 512kB sized file. See <a
 href="../started/transrom.htm">transrom</a> page for more details on this program.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">UAE</p>
<p class="text">Copy this file to the AHI driver drawer in Devs on your Workbench
  disk or hard disk. It is used to emulate the Amiga's sound system using AHI
  retargetable sound driver system.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">UAE.audio</p>
<p class="text">This is the AHI Driver for UAE. It enables support for recording
  and playback with a sampling rate up to 96 kHz in 16 bit. Copy this file to
  the Devs:AHI driver drawer in Devs on your Workbench disk or hard disk. It
  is used to emulate the Amiga's sound system using AHI retargetable sound driver
  system. This driver works fully independent from Paula sound. For a speed boost
  on slower systems, you can set the Paula buffer to 5 or 6, and chose 11kHz
  Mono, which is enough to hear system sounds.<br>
  If you installed the driver correctly, it should <span class="textmenu"></span> offer
  you only 1 mode: UAE hifi stereo++.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">UAE_German</p>
<p class="text">This is a German keymap file for access to @\~{[]} with ALT-GR
  like windows. Copy it to devs/keymaps and select in Input prefs.</p>
<p class="text">Note: This is a old one that work in input mode compatibility
  mode.For 100% compatibility Mode (Euro Char) use&nbsp; German_keymap_new.lha
  in this folder and choose anything other in input tab then Compatibility Mode
  and&nbsp; remap # Key to 0x2b.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">uae_rcli</p>
<p class="text">Remote CLI. Usage: uae_rcli [?|-h] [-debug] [-nofifo] [&lt;delay&gt;]</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">uae-control</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file to your Utilities folder or some other
  folder on your Workbnch disk or hard disk. It will provide you a user interface
  within the emulator to control the floppy drives, reset, quit and other features
  without having to press F12 to bring up the WinUAE interface.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="uaecontrol.gif" alt="UAE-Control"></p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">uaectrl</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk
  or hard disk. This is the Shell equivalent of the uae-control program which
  you can change floppies, sound, joystick, reset or quit the emulator from a
  simple text menu.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="uaectrl.gif" alt="UAE-Control Shell"></p>
<p class="headline2">WinUAEclip</p>
<p class="text">This program allows you to have access to Windows Clipboard so
  you can copy/paste files from/to WinUAE.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">WinUAEnforcer</p>
<p class="text">This program allows Enforcer support to detect bad memory access
  when developing programs or debugging. For 100% safety, use <a href="../emulation/jit.htm">JIT</a> in
  Indirect Mode. Make sure you use a tool that moves your VBR to Fast RAM. MCP
  or some other tools on Aminet do that. You can also use Segtracker from a real
  Amiga to find the program and offset of a hit.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">winxpprinthelper</p>
<p class="text">Not sure what this does yet. Need printer switched on before
  running this.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">p96_uae_tweak</p>
<p class="text">This features needs the p96_uae_tweak program attached in this
  mail. It must run after P96 monitordrivers in userstartup.<br>
  If you have copy this prog to <em>c:</em> then type <em>&gt;nil: c:p96_uae_tweak</em> in
  the CLI.<br>
  It is also recommended to set P96 memory from the 4 MB AIAB config to 16 or
  32 MB, because it works faster. If not enough gfx card space is free you will
  see flicker as before and slower moves. Save the config and restart WinUAE
  when you have increased the gfx memory size. Crashes may occur when you only
  reboot the emulated Amiga. <br>
  To test it you can boot AIAB open the screenmode prefs window. Now put the
  screenmode prefs window to back and move it around underneath other windows.<br>
  If the window moves fast and does not flicker all, you are done. With that
  patch it is also impossible that P96 graphics actions can block WinUAE, so
  you get no AHI 16bit sound stoddering when doing a lot of graphics actions.<br>
  The patch splits large P96 blits (&gt;60 pixels) in smaller blocks and checks
  in all blocks if a 16bit AHI buffer is free. This avoids speedlosses and sound
  stoddering with 4ms AHI latency. Swapbitmaprastport (used for solid windowmoving
  and some slow layer actions) is patched to use UAE blitter functions that exchange
  the data directly instead calling 3 times EOR. It is faster and avoids the
  heavy flickering when moving a smartlayer window underneath another window.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">ahitweak</p>
<p class="headline3">Usage: AHItweak&nbsp; posoffset,pollrtate</p>
<p class="text">This is a program you can start from the CLI or user-startup
  and allows you to tune the AHI driver for better latency, because on Windows
  XP the playpointer position has a delay depending on the system and soundcard
  used. Most users do not need this tool, but if you have crackle problems with
  16bit AHI, play a song and try values of 50, 200, 500, 2000, -50, -200, -500,
  and -2000. With some trying, you may be able to get good results.You may also
  try to set the pollrate which WinUAE checks for buffers freely between 10 and
  60. If you notice a speedloss you should set it to 60. If you use low latency
  music software that lets you chose AHI blocksizes less than&nbsp; 8 ms (AHI
  uses 20ms by default) you can set this to a lower value if you hear crackle.</p>
<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="headline2">p96refresh</p>
<p class="text">Start this program to get higher mousepointer redraw rates than
  50Hz with P96. Results are seen immediatly after call.You can start this in
  your user-startup for automatic load during booting the system.<br>
  <strong>Note:</strong> If you use this, you must check if your CPU IDLE slider
  is set in correct position. In the worst case, the Amiga system clock will
  run slower. Set the IDLE slider so that in Windows Taskmanager a CPU load of
  a workbench screen is show of about 10-15%.<br>
  <strong>Example:</strong> p96refresh 75 sets the redraw rate to 75Hz. It is
  recommended to set the rate according to the actual monitor refresh rate, or
  the doubled number. Do not set it higher or you get a speedloss greater than
  2%.</p>
