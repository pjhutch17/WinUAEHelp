<p class="headline1">Amiga Programs</p>
<p>Along with the WinUAE emulator program, some programs are supplied in the
  'Amiga Programs' folder in the C:\Program Files\WinUAE folder. Here is an explaination
  of what these files are for and where to copy them to:</p>
<p class="headline2">MouseHack</p>
<p>Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk or hard disk.
  This program will hack your mouse connected to your PC to work with WinUAE.
  In most cases it may not be needed. You can auto run it by adding a line to
  the s:user-startup file on your Workbench disk.</p>
<p class="headline2">Picasso96fix</p>
<p>Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk or hard disk.
  This program will fix Picasso 96 RTG screens greater than 1024 pixels when
  using your PC's graphics card with the uaegfx driver in WinUAE. Load it before
  LoadWB in the startup-sequence. The <strong>Picasso96fix.bb</strong> file is
  the source code to this program written in Blitz Basic.</p>
<p class="headline2">rtg.library</p>
<p>Re-targetable Graphics Library. Copy this library file your libs:picasso96.
  This library will avoid mousetrails and redraw problems in picasso96 when using
  JIT functions.</p>
<p class="headline2">timehack</p>
<p>This setst the correct time every second,useful when you hybernate your PC
  when winuae is running.</p>
<p class="headline2">transdisk</p>
<p>Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk or hard disk.
  This can Transfer Disk images to or from floppy disk to an image or vice versa
  in ADF (Amiga Disk Format). Type <strong>transdisk ?</strong> for more options.
  See <a href="transdisk.htm">trandisk</a> page for more details on this program.</p>
<p class="headline2">transrom</p>
<p>Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk or hard disk.
  This can Transfer the Kickstart rom image from a real Amiga to an image file
  to use with your Amiga Emulator. It will produce either a 256K or 512K sized
  file. See <a href="transrom.htm">transrom</a> page for more details on this
  program.</p>
<p class="headline2">UAE</p>
<p>Copy this file to the AHI driver drawer in Devs on your Workbench disk or
  hard disk. It is used to emulate the Amiga's sound system using AHI retargetable
  sound driver system.</p>
<p class="headline2">UAE.audio</p>
<p>Copy this file to the Devs:AHI driver drawer in Devs on your Workbench disk
  or hard disk. It is used to emulate the Amiga's sound system using AHI retargetable
  sound driver system. It will support 44.1khz 16Bit and 32khz.</p>
<p class="headline2">UAE_German</p>
<p>This is a German keymap file for access to @\~{[]} with ALT-GR like windows.
  Copy it to devs/keymaps and select in Input prefs.</p>
<p class="headline2">uae_rcli</p>
<p>Remote Cli. Usage: uae_rcli [?|-h] [-debug] [-nofifo] [&lt;delay&gt;]</p>
<p class="headline2">uae-control</p>
<p>Copy this program file to your Utilities folder or some other folder on your
  Workbench disk or hard disk. It will provide you a user interface within the
  emulator to control the floppy drives, reset, quit and other features without
  having to press F12 to bring up the WinUAE interface.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="uaecontrol.gif" alt="UAE-Control"></p>
<p class="headline2">uaectrl</p>
<p>Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk or hard disk.
  This is the Shell equivalent of the uae-control program which you can change
  floppies, sound, joystick, reset or quit the emulator from a simple text menu.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="uaectrl.gif" alt="UAE-Control Shell"></p>
<p class="headline2">winuaeclip</p>
<p>This program allows you to have access to Windows Clipboard so you can copy/paste
  files to/from WinUAE.</p>
<p class="headline2">winuaenforcer</p>
<p>This program allows Enforcer support, to detect bad memory access when developing
  programs or debugging.<br>
  For 100% safety, in JIT use Indirect Mode and set Speed to 2.</p>
<p class="headline2">winxpprinthelper</p>
<p>Not sure what this does yet. Need printer switched on before running this.</p>
<p class="headline2">uae_german</p>
<p class="text">This is a German keymap to reach @\~{[]} with ALT-GR like windows.
  Copy it in devs/keymaps and choose it in the keymap-prefs</p>
<p class="headline2">p96_uae_tweak</p>
<p>This features need the p96_uae_tweak program attached in this mail. It must
  run after P96 monitordrivers in userstartup<br>If you have copy this prog to
  c:<br>
  run &gt;nil: c:p96_uae_tweak.<br>
  I also recommend to set P96 mem from the 4 MB AIAB config to 16 or 32 MB,because
  it works faster. If not enough gfx card space is free you see flicker as before
  and slower move Restart whole winuae when you have increase gfx memsize and
    save the config.<br>
    I notice crashes when only reboot.<br>To test it you can boot AIAB open the screenmode prefs window.<br>Now put the screenmode prefs window to back and move it around under other<br>windows.<br>
    Now if the window move fast and do not flicker all work ok. With that patch
    it is also impossible that P96 graphic actions can block winuae,so you get
    no AHI 16bit soundstodder when doing large graphic actions.<br>
  The patch split for this large P96 blits (&gt;60 pixel)in smaller blocks
    and check in all blocks if a 16 bit ahi buffer is free.No speedloss seen,no
  stodder notice with 4ms AHI Latency.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swapbitmaprastport (used for solid windowmoving and some slow layer<br>
</p>
<p>actions)is patched<br>
</p>
<p>to use a UAE blitter functions that direct exchange the data instead calling<br>
</p>
<p>3* eor <br>
</p>
<p>It is faster and avoid the heavy flickering when move a smartlayer window<br>
</p>
<p>under another window <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> restoretime (download from Aminet)<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set every second the clock to windows clock time.<br>
</p>
<p>You need this when you hybernate your PC and resume to get exact time.<br>
</p>
<p>If you need exact time (for compiler make) i recommend also to use this<br>
</p>
<p>because UAE cycletiming make diffrence of 1-2 sec in a hour.<br>
</p>
<p>It have no speedloss <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> ahitweak<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a program you can start from shell or user-startup<br>
</p>
<p>and allow you to tune the ahi driver for better latency,because on winxp the <br>
</p>
<p>playpointer position have a delay depend on system and soundcard<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can reach with <br>
</p>
<p>ahitweak 200 <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>latency of 4 ms with my sb-PCI512 on winxp (simular sb-live) <br>
</p>
<p>to get hd-rec working with 4ms<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see thats more a function to get the best for realtime Music without special <br>
</p>
<p>ASIO drivers<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most users dont need that<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you have crackle problems WITH 16 BIT AHI <br>
</p>
<p>play a song and try values of 50 200 500 2000 -50 -200 -500 -2000<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe that help <br>
</p>
<p> p96refresh (winuae only)<br>
</p>
<p>Start this program to get higher mousepointer redraw rates than 50 hz<br>
</p>
<p>with P96.Actions are seen immediatly after call.You can start this in your <br>
</p>
<p>user-startup for automatic on boot <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example:<br>
</p>
<p> p96refresh 75 <br>
</p>
<p>set redraw rate to 75 hz.Best is if you set rate <br>
</p>
<p> to your monitor refresh rate or monitor refreshrate*2<br>
</p>
<p> Dont set it higher or you get speedloss &gt; 2% <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> rtg.library: (help also on Standard UAE)<br>
</p>
<p>This avoid large slowdown and redraw problems in picasso96 with JIT<br>
</p>
<p>copy it in libs:pacasso96<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> picasso96fix (help also on Standard UAE)<br>
</p>
<p>This allow larger Screen Width than 1024 <br>
</p>
<p>start it BEFORE the loadwb instruction in startup-sequence</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> uae/uae.audio (winuae only)<br>
</p>
<p>This is the AHI Driver.This allow support for record and playback upto 96
  khz<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>copy uae to devs:audiomodes<br>
</p>
<p>copy uae.audio to devs:ahi<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you install correct the driver should show Version 4.3 Date 22.5.02 <br>
</p>
<p>and offer you only 1 Mode UAE hifi stereo++. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This driver work fully independent from paula sound.For a speed <br>
</p>
<p>boost on slower systems you can set paula buffer to 5 or 6 choose 11 khz mono<br>
</p>
<p>thats enough to hear system sound</p>
