<p class="headline1">Amiga Programs</p>
<p class="text">Along with the WinUAE emulator program, some programs are supplied
  in the 'Amiga Programs' folder in the C:\Program Files\WinUAE folder. Here
  is an explaination of what these files are for and where to copy them to:</p>
<p class="headline2">MouseHack</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk
  or hard disk. This program will hack your mouse connected to your PC to work
  with WinUAE. In most cases it may not be needed. You can auto run it by adding
  a line to the s:user-startup file on your Workbench disk.</p>
<p class="headline2">Picasso96fix</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk
  or hard disk. This program will fix Picasso 96 RTG screens greater than 1024
  pixels when using your PC's graphics card with the uaegfx driver in WinUAE.
  Load it before LoadWB in the startup-sequence. The <strong>Picasso96fix.bb</strong> file
  is the source code to this program written in Blitz Basic.</p>
<p class="headline2">rtg.library</p>
<p class="text">Re-targetable Graphics Library. Copy this library file your libs:picasso96.
  This library will avoid mousetrails and redraw problems in picasso96 when using
  JIT functions.</p>
<p class="headline2">timehack</p>
<p class="text">This setst the correct time every second,useful when you hybernate
  your PC when winuae is running. Copy it to the Amiga system directory c. Start
  it in your Userstartup with the command <span class="textmenu">run &gt;nil:
  timehack</span>.</p>
<p class="headline2">transdisk</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk
  or hard disk. This can Transfer Disk images to or from floppy disk to an image
  or vice versa in ADF (Amiga Disk Format). Type <em>transdisk ?</em> for
  more options. See <a href="../started/transdisk.htm">trandisk</a> page for more details
  on this program.</p>
<p class="headline2">transrom</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk
  or hard disk. This can Transfer the Kickstart rom image from a real Amiga to
  an image file to use with your Amiga Emulator. It will produce either a 256K
  or 512K sized file. See <a href="../started/transrom.htm">transrom</a> page for more details
  on this program.</p>
<p class="headline2">UAE</p>
<p class="text">Copy this file to the AHI driver drawer in Devs on your Workbench
  disk or hard disk. It is used to emulate the Amiga's sound system using AHI
  retargetable sound driver system.</p>
<p class="headline2">UAE.audio</p>
<p class="text">This is the AHI Driver for UAE. It enables support for recording
  and playback with a sampling rate up to 96 kHz. Copy this file to the Devs:AHI
  driver drawer in Devs on your Workbench disk or hard disk. It is used to emulate
  the Amiga's sound system using AHI retargetable sound driver system. This driver
  works fully independent from Paula sound. For a speed boost on slower systems,
  you can set the Paula buffer to 5 or 6, and chose 11kHz Mono, which is enough
  to hear system sounds.<br>
  If you installed the driver correctly, it should show <span class="textmenu">Version
  4.3 Date 22.05.02</span> and offer you only 1 mode: UAE hifi stereo++. </p>
<p class="headline2">UAE_German</p>
<p class="text">This is a German keymap file for access to @\~{[]} with ALT-GR
  like windows. Copy it to devs/keymaps and select in Input prefs.</p>
<p class="headline2">uae_rcli</p>
<p class="text">Remote CLI. Usage: uae_rcli [?|-h] [-debug] [-nofifo] [&lt;delay&gt;]</p>
<p class="headline2">uae-control</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file to your Utilities folder or some other
  folder on your Workbench disk or hard disk. It will provide you a user interface
  within the emulator to control the floppy drives, reset, quit and other features
  without having to press F12 to bring up the WinUAE interface.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="uaecontrol.gif" alt="UAE-Control"></p>
<p class="headline2">uaectrl</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your Workbench disk
  or hard disk. This is the Shell equivalent of the uae-control program which
  you can change floppies, sound, joystick, reset or quit the emulator from a
  simple text menu.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="uaectrl.gif" alt="UAE-Control Shell"></p>
<p class="headline2">winuaeclip</p>
<p class="text">This program allows you to have access to Windows Clipboard so
  you can copy/paste files to/from WinUAE.</p>
<p class="headline2">winuaenforcer</p>
<p class="text">This program allows Enforcer support, to detect bad memory access
  when developing programs or debugging.<br>
  For 100% safety, in JIT use Indirect Mode and set Speed to 2.</p>
<p class="headline2">winxpprinthelper</p>
<p class="text">Not sure what this does yet. Need printer switched on before
  running this.</p>
<p class="headline2">p96_uae_tweak</p>
<p class="text">This features need the p96_uae_tweak program attached in this
  mail. It must run after P96 monitordrivers in userstartup<br>
  If you have copy this prog to c:<br>
  run &gt;nil: c:p96_uae_tweak.<br>
  I also recommend to set P96 mem from the 4 MB AIAB config to 16 or 32 MB,because
  it works faster. If not enough gfx card space is free you see flicker as before
  and slower move Restart whole winuae when you have increase gfx memsize and
  save the config.<br>
  I notice crashes when only reboot.<br>
  To test it you can boot AIAB open the screenmode prefs window.<br>
  Now put the screenmode prefs window to back and move it around under other<br>
  windows.<br>
  Now if the window move fast and do not flicker all work ok. With that patch
  it is also impossible that P96 graphic actions can block winuae,so you get
  no AHI 16bit soundstodder when doing large graphic actions.<br>
  The patch split for this large P96 blits (&gt;60 pixel)in smaller blocks and
  check in all blocks if a 16 bit ahi buffer is free.No speedloss seen,no stodder
  notice with 4ms AHI Latency. Swapbitmaprastport (used for solid windowmoving
  and some slow layer actions) is patched to use a UAE blitter functions that
  direct exchange the data instead calling 3* eor. It is faster and avoid the
  heavy flickering when move a smartlayer window under another window.</p>
<p class="headline2">restoretime</p>
<p class="text">This tools synchronizes the Amiga time with the current Windows
  time every second. You need this when you use the hibernation feature of your
  PC and resume to get exact time. If you need exact time (for compiler make)
  it is also recommended to use this because UAE cycletiming differs of about
  1-2 seconds per hour.</p>
<p class="headline2">ahitweak</p>
<p class="text">This is a program you can start from the CLI or user-startup
  and allows you to tune the AHI driver for better latency, because on Windows
  XP the playpointer position has a delay depending on the system and soundcard
  used. Most users do not need this tool, but if you have crackle problems with
  16bit AHI, play a song and try values of 50, 200, 500, 2000, -50, -200, -500,
  and -2000. With some trying, you may be able to get good results.</p>
<p class="headline2">p96refresh</p>
<p class="text">Start this program to get higher mousepointer redraw rates than
  50Hz with P96.Actions are seen immediatly after call.You can start this in
  your user-startup for automatic load during booting the system.</p>
<p class="text">Example: p96refresh 75 sets the redraw rate to 75Hz. It is recommended
  to set the rate according to the actual monitor refresh rate, or the doubled
  number. Do not set it higher or you get a speedloss greater than 2%.</p>
