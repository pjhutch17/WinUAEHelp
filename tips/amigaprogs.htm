<p class="headline1">Amiga Programs</p>
<p class="text">Along with the WinUAE emulator program, some programs
are supplied in the 'Amiga Programs' folder in the C:\Program
Files\WinUAE folder. Here is an explaination of what these files are
for and where to copy them to:</p>
<p class="headline2">MouseHack</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your
Workbench disk or hard disk. This program will hack your mouse
connected to your PC to work with WinUAE. In most cases it may not be
needed. You can auto run it by adding a line to the s:user-startup file
on your Workbench disk.</p>
<p class="headline2">Picasso96fix</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your
Workbench disk or hard disk. This program will fix Picasso 96 RTG
screens greater than 1024 pixels when using your PC's graphics card
with the uaegfx driver in WinUAE. Load it before LoadWB in the
startup-sequence. The <strong>Picasso96fix.bb</strong> file is the
source code to this program written in Blitz Basic.</p>
<p class="headline2">rtg.library</p>
<p class="text">Re-targetable Graphics Library. Copy this library file
to your libs:picasso96. This library will&nbsp; increase the speed of
winuae very much<br>
</p>
<p class="headline2">timehack</p>
<p class="text">This tool synchronizes the Amiga time with the current
Windows time every second. You need this when you use the hibernation
feature of your PC and resume to get exact time. If you need exact time
(for compiler make) it is also recommended to use this because UAE
cycletiming differs of about 1-2 seconds per hour.</p>
<p class="text">Copy it to the Amiga system directory c. Start it in
your Userstartup with the command <span class="textmenu">run &gt;nil:
timehack</span>.</p>
<p class="headline2">transdisk</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your
Workbench disk or hard disk. This can Transfer Disk images to or from
floppy disk to an image or vice versa in ADF (Amiga Disk Format). Type <em>transdisk
?</em> for more options. See <a href="../started/transdisk.htm">trandisk</a>
page for more details on this program.</p>
<p class="headline2">transrom</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your
Workbench disk or hard disk. This can Transfer the Kickstart rom image
from a real Amiga to an image file to use with your Amiga Emulator. It
will produce either a 256K or 512K sized file. See <a
 href="../started/transrom.htm">transrom</a> page for more details on
this program.</p>
<p class="headline2">UAE</p>
<p class="text">Copy this file to the AHI driver drawer in Devs on your
Workbench disk or hard disk. It is used to emulate the Amiga's sound
system using AHI retargetable sound driver system.</p>
<p class="headline2">UAE.audio</p>
<p class="text">This is the AHI Driver for UAE. It enables support for
recording and playback with a sampling rate up to 96 kHz in 16 bit.
Copy this file to the Devs:AHI driver drawer in Devs on your Workbench
disk or hard disk. It is used to emulate the Amiga's sound system using
AHI retargetable sound driver system. This driver works fully
independent from Paula sound. For a speed boost on slower systems, you
can set the Paula buffer to 5 or 6, and chose 11kHz Mono, which is
enough to hear system sounds.<br>
If you installed the driver correctly, it should <span class="textmenu"></span>
offer you only 1 mode: UAE hifi stereo++. </p>
<p class="headline2">UAE_German</p>
<p class="text">This is a German keymap file for access to @\~{[]} with
ALT-GR like windows. Copy it to devs/keymaps and select in Input prefs.</p>
<p class="text">Note: This is a old one that work in input mode
compatibility mode.For 100% compatibility Mode (Euro Char) use&nbsp;
German_keymap_new.lha in this folder and choose anything other in input
tab then Compatibility Mode and&nbsp; remap # Key to 0x2b <br>
</p>
<p class="headline2">uae_rcli</p>
<p class="text">Remote CLI. Usage: uae_rcli [?|-h] [-debug] [-nofifo]
[&lt;delay&gt;]</p>
<p class="headline2">uae-control</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file to your Utilities folder or some
other folder on your Workbnch disk or hard disk. It will provide you a
user interface within the emulator to control the floppy drives, reset,
quit and other features without having to press F12 to bring up the
WinUAE interface.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="uaecontrol.gif" alt="UAE-Control"></p>
<p class="headline2">uaectrl</p>
<p class="text">Copy this program file your C directory on your
Workbench disk or hard disk. This is the Shell equivalent of the
uae-control program which you can change floppies, sound, joystick,
reset or quit the emulator from a simple text menu.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="uaectrl.gif" alt="UAE-Control Shell"></p>
<p class="headline2">winuaeclip</p>
<p class="text">This program allows you to have access to Windows
Clipboard so you can copy/paste files to/from WinUAE.</p>
<p class="headline2">winuaenforcer</p>
<p class="text">This program allows Enforcer support, to detect bad
memory access when developing programs or debugging.<br>
For 100% safety, in JIT use Indirect Mode.Make sure you use a tool that
move your&nbsp; VBR to fastram.MCP&nbsp; or some other tools on aminet
do that.Segtracker from Real amiga you can use too to find the program
and offset of a hit<br>
</p>
<p class="headline2">winxpprinthelper</p>
<p class="text">Not sure what this does yet. Need printer switched on
before running this.</p>
<p class="headline2">p96_uae_tweak</p>
<p class="text">This features need the p96_uae_tweak program attached
in this mail. It must run after P96 monitordrivers in userstartup<br>
If you have copy this prog to c:<br>
run &gt;nil: c:p96_uae_tweak.<br>
I also recommend to set P96 mem from the 4 MB AIAB config to 16 or 32
MB,because it works faster. If not enough gfx card space is free you
see flicker as before and slower move Restart whole winuae when you
have increase gfx memsize and save the config.<br>
I notice crashes when only reboot.<br>
To test it you can boot AIAB open the screenmode prefs window.<br>
Now put the screenmode prefs window to back and move it around under
other<br>
windows.<br>
Now if the window move fast and do not flicker all work ok. With that
patch it is also impossible that P96 graphic actions can block
winuae,so you get no AHI 16bit soundstodder when doing large graphic
actions.<br>
The patch split for this large P96 blits (&gt;60 pixel)in smaller
blocks and check in all blocks if a 16 bit ahi buffer is free.No
speedloss seen,no stodder notice with 4ms AHI Latency.
Swapbitmaprastport (used for solid windowmoving and some slow layer
actions) is patched to use a UAE blitter functions that direct exchange
the data instead calling 3* eor. It is faster and avoid the heavy
flickering when move a smartlayer window under another window.</p>

</p>
<p class="headline2">ahitweak</p>
<p class="headline2">Usage: ahitweak&nbsp; posoffset,pollrtate<br>
</p>
<p class="text">This is a program you can start from the CLI or
user-startup and allows you to tune the AHI driver for better latency,
because on Windows XP the playpointer position has a delay depending on
the system and soundcard used. Most users do not need this tool, but if
you have crackle problems with 16bit AHI, play a song and try values of
50, 200, 500, 2000, -50, -200, -500, and -2000. With some trying, you
may be able to get good results.You can too set with the second
parameter the Pollrate which winuae check for a buffer free between 10
and 60.If you notice speedloss you can set to 60.If you use lowlatency
Musik Software that let you choose ahi blocksizes less than&nbsp; 8
ms(ahi use by default 20 ms)you can set this to a lower value if you
hear crackle.Maybe this help<br>

<p class="headline2">p96refresh</p>
<p class="text">Start this program to get higher mousepointer redraw
rates than 50Hz with P96.Actions are seen immediatly after call.You can
start this in your user-startup for automatic load during booting the
system.</p>
<p class="text">Note:If&nbsp; you use this,you must check if your
cpuidle slider is set in correct position.In worst case your clock run
slower.Set the CPUIDLE slider so that in Windows Taskmanager a CPU load
of a workbench screen is show of about 10-15%.This is ok and all work
well<br>
</p>
<p class="text">Example: p96refresh 75 sets the redraw rate to 75Hz. It
is recommended to set the rate according to the actual monitor refresh
rate, or the doubled number. Do not set it higher or you get a
speedloss greater than 2%.</p>
